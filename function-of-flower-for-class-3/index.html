Come in all colors, shapes and sizes and have sweet smell to attract insects to visit them.

Another flower could rely on humans for pollination. The most important function of flowers is reproduction. Many flowers have male parts and female parts. A flower may be trimerous, tetramerous or pentamerous when the floral leaves of each whorl are in multiple of 3, 4 or 5, respectively.
