<p>Instead of building many products and then holding them in line for the next step in the process, products go through each step in the process one at a time, without interruption. A single unit of product flows between different processes. The concept has been around since at least the 1940’s and it’s called “one piece flow”, or just flow for short. One piece flow method one piece flow method, sometimes called continuous flow, is a production method used instead of traditional mass production. “one piece flow” is all about reducing wip to the point where everything is either waiting to be started, in progress, or complete.</p>

<p>Ravensburger 1000 Piece Puzzle Awesome Alphabet A Awesome In mass production, materials move through the manufacturing process in batches which can be highly inefficient. To facilitate production without waiting, the maximum number of products waiting between two workstations is 1. One piece flow first exposes the waste, and also guides the design of processes that are more lean (space, inventory, equipment size, energy use, human motion, etc). (1) the opposite of batch and queue; → in opposite conditions, we might process an entire batch or lot at each station before moving it to the next station.

<p>Pin by Joann McMonagle on Flow Magazine Flow magazine This maximum means that the upstream workstation is only allowed to start working on the next product when the slot behind. The concept has been around since at least the 1940’s and it’s called “one piece flow”, or just flow for short. For accomplishing these objectives, business owners have to decide whether to adopt the lean manufacturing one piece flow approach or mass production. One piece flow first exposes the waste, and also guides the design of processes that are more lean (space, inventory, equipment size, energy use, human motion, etc). Toyota gives the most importance to that point. One piece flow is not the ideal nor the end, but a means to an end.</p>

To facilitate production without waiting, the maximum number of products waiting between two workstations is 1. Instead of building many products and then holding them in line for the next step in the process, products go through each step in the process one at a time, without interruption. That is, the right parts can be made available when they are needed in the quantity they are needed.</p>
