<p><strong>High Flow Oxygen Devices Covid</strong>, In recent years, high flow nasal cannula (hfnc) is a respiratory support system that has become prominent in the treatment of respiratory failure. However, there is a concern this may aerosolize. In recent years, hfno has become a commonly used therapy for patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure.</p>
