Peace lilies can tolerate short periods of dry soil, but their leaves will start to brown if neglected for too long.

<p>How To Care For A Peace Lily Plant Peace lily plant care This will give you plant plenty of time to reestablish in it’s new pot. Peace lilies are native to hot, moist, shady tropical rainforests. I can see some blackening at the edge of a couple of leaves too though, which often indicates a water problem, or being near a heat source. However, inside, where it is usually relatively warm and humid compared to the outside environment, the plant can do well. As a general rule, watering once each week to soak the entire root ball and letting the plant drain thoroughly prevents excessively dry or wet soil. You can cut the whole flower stem off at that point.</p>

<p>Peace lily is a low light indoor houseplant that flowers However, inside, where it is usually relatively warm and humid compared to the outside environment, the plant can do well. Peace lilies are native to hot, moist, shady tropical rainforests. First, flush the plant with lots of bottled water until it runs out of the drainage holes. Tips of the leaves turn brown. They will recover just fine or you just snip bits of the brownish or yellowed parts. If you reckon that you are dealing with a high salt content in your water, the next time you water the plant, you can use distilled water to irrigate and flush everything out.</p>
