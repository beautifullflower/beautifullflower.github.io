<p><strong>Simple Ebb And Flow Hydroponic System</strong>, All of the systems work on the basic premise of a tray filling with water for root nourishment and then draining into a reservoir. Pots are filled with an inert medium which does not function like soil or contribute nutrition to the plants but which anchors the plant roots and functions as a temporary reserve of water and solvent mineral nutrients.

Using a measuring cup i added 110ml of each into my 55l container. How a hydroponic flood and drain system operates quite simple. The main part of the flood and drain system holds the containers the plants are growing in. (the water is, of course, mixed with nutrients.) a thin film will adhere to the gravel allowing the plant roots to gather nutrients even after the container has been drained. It’s easier to maintain and a bit more forgiving than a dwc system in case you mess up the temperature, ph, or nutrient profile.</p>
