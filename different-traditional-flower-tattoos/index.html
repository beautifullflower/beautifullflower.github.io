<p>Thanks so much Nicolette! 🖤 Traditional tattoo flowers Lotus bloom into the mud and thus lotus tattoo will represent faith and determination to overcome all obstacles. The look is so iconic that regardless of its similarities to japanese tattoos, they are instantly recognizable. Jonquil flowers are often mistaken for daffodils because of their similar bloom, but a traditional jonquil usually has white leaves with a yellow casing near the seeds giving it a much different feel. Feminine, beautiful and fragrant, flower tattoos have long been the purview of the fairer sex. Often, the eggplant flower will be the first tattoo a young man in a dayak tribe gets. Though often colored red in tattoo art, the peony tattoo can be a wide range of colors.</p>
