<p>Crosswater Waldorf 3 Hole Basin Mixer Tap WF130DPC_LVPV Although you’ll want a low flow rate, you will also want to maintain a decent pressure. 95% of the water will fall within a radius of 400mm for eye showers the jets should reach a minimum of 100mm from the centre of the spray head spraying directly upwards. You are unmetered), you still need to heat the water for showers, so using less hot water, means you have to heat less, so you save on your heating. At present there is a three year old combi boiler providing hot water. Cold water supply pressure is approximately 3 bar. In the usa the maximum flow permitted from a shower head is 9.5 litres a minute and the uk government is looking to bring in an even lower rate of perhaps 8 or 9 litres a minute.</p>
