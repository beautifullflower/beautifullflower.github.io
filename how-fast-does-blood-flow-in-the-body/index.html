<p>Pin by Taby RubioMoulier on Workouts in 2020 Turbo fire A study from 2016 on the connection between stretching and blood flow found that it benefits your cardiovascular system. The body responds by repairing damaged areas, making them stronger and bigger. If a blood clot occurs in an arm or leg and breaks away, it can cause circulation problems and even possibly result in a stroke. This impairs the parts of the body that the brain cells control. Your heart is the pump that makes it all possible. A typical human body contains 5.6 liters (6 quarts) of blood.</p>

Using these 10 Natural Because the heart is at the center of the body’s blood flow, it’s important to have a healthy heart if you aim for optimal circulation everywhere in your body. That’s fast enough so that a drug injected into an arm reaches the brain in only a few seconds. The american heart association points out that based on an average of 100,000 beats each day, the heart pumps out 2,000 gallons of blood. But if a blood clot forms inside the body, it can slow down blood flow and potentially be very dangerous. People are usually able to donate blood every 56 days. Read it in the reader�s digest book of the human body answer:</p>

Blood flow is the amount of blood flowing through a vessel or the entire circulation in a given period of time.

Any factor that causes cardiac output to increase, by elevating heart rate or stroke volume or both, will elevate blood pressure and promote blood flow.</p>
