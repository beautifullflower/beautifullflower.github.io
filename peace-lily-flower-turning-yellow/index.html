<p>Cooler Temps White flowering plants, Purple flowering This browning can be caused by too little or too much watering. Since peace lilies are primarily kept as houseplants, they are almost always watered with tap water. Too much direct sunlight burns the leaves and that’s why they turn yellow. However, selective leaf yellowing often occurs several days to a week after a drought episode. First, i don�t know whether the blackening on the spathe is caused by a deposit of some sort that can be rubbed off, like a mould of some sort, but either way, it seems likely your plant is either being over watered, or is left sitting in water in some outer container or tray. When your peace lily becomes too large for its pot, you may notice that it seems to require increasingly frequent watering and/or that its leaves turn yellow for no apparent reason.</p>
