<p>Pin di Science Ed Stamen is the male reproductive organ or microsporophyll of a flower. It has three main parts called, stigma, style and ovary. The anther consists of four saclike structures (microsporangia) that produce pollen for pollination. Androecium is the third whorl of the flower. They consist of two parts, the filament and the anther. The hair is called the filament and the follicle is the anther where pollen is produced.</p>
