<p>Pin by Amy Ngo on Animal crossing game in 2020 Animal New horizons on the nintendo switch, a gamefaqs message board topic titled how the hell do you replant flowers?. The flower only makes an appearance once your island reaches a 5 star island evaluation. Lily (レイニー reinī?, rainy) is a frog villager in the animal crossing series with a normal personality. They spawn only when the town is in perfect condition. The clusters of flowers bloom in spring and summer. Lily of the valley, the flower erroneously called jacob�s ladder in the animal crossing games.</p>
