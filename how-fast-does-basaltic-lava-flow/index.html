<p><strong>How Fast Does Basaltic Lava Flow</strong>, Many of the names of lava flows come from hawaii because the majority of lava study and discovery has taken place there. However, the viscosity of lava goes up fast when more silica is added. When lava flows from a shield volcano, it moves more quickly than other types of lava because of its viscosity.</p>

<p>Lava flow speeds vary based primarily on viscosity and slope. Lava flow speeds vary based primarily on viscosity and slope. How hot is basaltic mafic lava? Probably the two biggest factors are viscosity and rate of shear strain. But when basalt lava flows are confined within a channel or lava tube on a steep slope, the main body of the flow can reach velocities &gt;30 km/h (19 mph).</p>

<p>Obsidian is often formed in rhyolite lava flows where the Lava is composed of hot molten rock (magma) mixed with dissolved gases. However, the viscosity of lava goes up fast when more silica is added. There are two major groupings of eruptions: As lava travels down the volcano sides, the surface of the flow will cool much more rapidly. What speed does basaltic lava flow travel? This is slightly faster than walking pace, but it’s a safe bet that you would be able to outrun it.</p>

<p>Obsidian is often formed in rhyolite lava flows where the Some rhyolite lava domes and coulees (kind of like a hybrid of a dome and flow) can be hundreds of feet thick. There are two major groupings of eruptions: For example, an estimated 58% of the lava forming kīlauea comes from lava tubes. This refers to the “thickness,” or heaviness, of the liquified substance. Dull red colors indicates a temperature in the range of 600…700 °c. Many of the names of lava flows come from hawaii because the majority of lava study and discovery has taken place there.</p>

Lava tubes can account for a large portion of shield volcano activity; On shallower slopes the flow will move less than 10km/hr (6 mile/hr) and most probably around 1 km/hr (thats like 1 foot a second). Viscosity is just how sticky something is (how much it resists flowing).

However, the viscosity of lava goes up fast when more silica is added. When lava flows from a shield volcano, it moves more quickly than other types of lava because of its viscosity. So for example, a basaltic lava flow moving over a steep slope inside a lava tube will flow around 30 km/hr (19 miles/hr).
