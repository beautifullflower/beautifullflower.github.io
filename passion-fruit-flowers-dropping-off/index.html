The other common reason why passion fruit drop their fruits is when theyï¿½re lacking trace elements. Jerry explains why passionfruit fruit drop early, jane shares advice on feeding pot plants and tino advises on what vegies to plant in the shade For example, if your soil contains too much boron, the leaf tips might yellow. We recommend fertilising your nellie kelly passionfruit vine twice a year.

<p>Beautiful flowers, fruit and exotic plants grow throughout I have a mature passion fruit vine and it gets lots of flowers and fruit on it, however before the fruit reaches maturity it falls off, i have cut one of these open before and they and not ripe. Keep chopping the unwanted shoots off, although not sure why you have this happening, may be the graft is not attached well. You can buy trace element supplements and feed your vines accordingly since passion fruit need a lot of feeding. The yellow fruiting passionfruit vine blooms from april through november, while the purple vine flowers for a shorter season from march into april.

Once in early spring after pruning, and again in autumn when fruiting has finished. Probably the most common problem for passionfruit grown in home gardens is poor fruit set, which is generally due to a lack of flowers being pollinated. Beyond this, passionfruit can be pretty sensitive to climatic extremes and nutrient imbalances. My tree needs water twice a day and fertilizer to set/develope fruits. It is flowering superfluously but the flowers keep falling off.</p>

You can tell when most purple varieties are ripe as they drop off the vine and onto the ground. The plant doesnï¿½t have the resources to support fruit production so it drops them to conserve energy for the main plant. There are a lot of ants all over the vine. In those instances, the yellow coloring will show up particularly between the leaf veins. See attached photos of my tree.</p>
