Peak flow measurement is a quick test to measure air flowing out of the lungs. It measures the airflow through the bronchi and thus the degree of obstruction in the airways. The measurement relates to how well the air is moving through your airways, so if asthma is present with airway inflammation or bronchoconstriction, the peak flow levels will be lower. Peak expiratory flow (pef), also called peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) is a person’s maximum speed of expiration, as measured with a peak flow meter like the unit available from activ8rlives. 1if you experience any of these warning symptoms put a tick in the box for that day.</p>

Be aware of the following general guidelines. Explain the purpose of a peak flow meter and peak expiratory flow rate (pefr). For women, the equivalent figure is 85 l/min. The peak expiratory flow (pef) is the maximum flow obtained within the first 200 milliseconds of a forced expiratory maneuver after inhalation to total lung capacity (tlc).
