<p>Pin on Do Yoga Perfect for anyone new to yoga or those who prefer a slower practice. Slow flow yoga is for all age groups, and it encourages the practice of mindfulness or staying in the moment. Slow yoga gives the prana enough time to break up blocks in the physiology and begin to move. That way, yoga can support the healing process and help the person experience symptoms with more centeredness and less distress. It also helps our minds to relax. My gentle flow yoga classes offer a deliberate, slower paced approach that is gentle and revitalising.</p>
