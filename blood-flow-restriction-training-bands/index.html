<p><strong>Blood Flow Restriction Training Bands</strong>, Blood flow restriction training has emerged in the fitness and rehab worlds as the latest modality to help patients get their strength and muscle mass back faster than ever. This tricks the brain into thinking the muscles are working harder than they are and stimulates the production of growth hormones, increasing energy levels, improving strength and performance, and regulating the metabolism. Based on the science behind japanese kaatsu and blood flow restriction (bfr) training methods, we have developed an improved training method called optimization training that you can use in the gym or at home.</p>

<p>Blood flow restriction training is a favorite among elite athletes and fitness enthusiasts who use bfr to enhance their performance levels and reach their goals. What is blood flow restriction training, or occlusion training? Bfr involves wrapping a device such as a pressure cuff, kaatsu device, or even knee wraps around the top portion of a limb to restrict blood flow out of the working muscle. It involves placing a tourniquet around the limb during exercise to restrict the blood flow from the working muscle. We’ll even show you a variety of recommended bfr cuffs at different price points.</p>

When done correctly, arterial blood flow is (mostly) unobstructed so blood can flow into the limb, but venous blood flow—blood pumping out of the limb—is impeded. Bfr involves wrapping a device such as a pressure cuff, kaatsu device, or even knee wraps around the top portion of a limb to restrict blood flow out of the working muscle. See gains in muscle strength, stamina, speed and agility. Blood flow restriction (bfr) training uses specially designed bands that modify the blood flow to the limb.</p>
