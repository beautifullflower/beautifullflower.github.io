<p>Cyclic electron flow definition a route of electron flow during the light reactions of photosynthesis that involves only photosystem i and that produces atp but not nadph or oxygen In light reaction, addition of phosphate in the presence of light is called photophosphorylation. In cyclic electron flow, the electron starts in a pigment complex called photosystem i, then it passes from the primary acceptor to ferredoxin then to plastoquinone, and then to cytochrome b6f (a similar complex to that is also found in mitochondria), and then to plastocyanin before coming back to chlorophyll. The earliest measurements that gave an indication that a cyclic flow of electrons could occur around the psi reaction centre involved the addition of artificial electron mediators. Clearly the electron flow was from the electron donor and back to the same compound (fig.</p>

<p>(1) The Calvin cycle The Calvin cycle Photosynthesis Only photosystem i is involved. Cyclic electron flow in a sense (well, metaphorically) is a � short circuiting� of the normal z scheme of the light reaction of photosynthesis where energy that otherwise would have gone into making nadph instead is diverted towards making more atp.

In cyclic electron flow, the electron starts in a pigment complex called photosystem i, then it passes from the primary acceptor to ferredoxin then to plastoquinone, and then to cytochrome b6f (a similar complex to that is also found in mitochondria), and then to plastocyanin before coming back to chlorophyll. In light reaction, addition of phosphate in the presence of light is called photophosphorylation. Cyclic electron flow , electrons ejected from p700 reach ferredoxin and flow back.</p>

<p>Pin on Cellular Respiration Cyclic electron flow definition a route of electron flow during the light reactions of photosynthesis that involves only photosystem i and that produces atp but not nadph or oxygen Photophosphorylationrefers to the use of light energy to ultimately provide the energy to convert adp to atp, thus replenishing the universal energy currency in living things. Cyclic photophosphorylation the photophosphorylation occurring an cyclic electron transport called cyclic photophosphorylation. Alternatively, electrons may be transferred only by light reaction i, in which case they are recycled from ferredoxin back to the intermediate carriers. Terms in this set (5) only photsystem one is used which contains a pigment complex and electron acceptor. The electron begins in a pigment complex called photosystem i in cyclic electron flow.</p>

<p>The proton gradient obtained by the electron transport It takes place under the condition of low light intensity and light of wavelength lower than 680 nm and when co 2 fixation is inhibited. Cyclic electron flow definition a route of electron flow during the light reactions of photosynthesis that involves only photosystem i and that produces atp but not nadph or o2. This process is called cyclic electron flow. H+ is pumped into the thylakoid space. Under certain conditions, the photoexcited electrons take an alternative path called cyclic electron flow, which uses photosystem i (p700) but not photosystem ii (p680). In light reaction, addition of phosphate in the presence of light is called photophosphorylation.</p>

Definition for noncyclic electron flow. Only photosystem i is involved. This type of photophosphorylation usually occurs in the thylakoid membrane. In the simplest systems in prokaryotes, photosynthesis is used just for the production of energy, and not for the building of any biological molecules. Cyclic electron flow is the simplest pathway, but involves only photosystem i.</p>
