Organisms in an ecosystem acquire energy in a variety of ways, which is transferred between trophic levels as the energy flows from the bottom to the top of the food web, with energy being lost at each transfer. The process ends when the carnivores die and get decomposed, thereby becoming food for plants and starting the cycle again. The ecosystems on earth can harness/process a very small fraction of solar energy reaching the earth. Energy never flows backward from consumers to producers.</p>

The process ends when the carnivores die and get decomposed, thereby becoming food for plants and starting the cycle again. How much energy consumed by primary consumers is eventually consumed by tertiary consumers. At the first trophic level, primary producers use solar energy to produce organic material through photosynthesis. The image below shows a part of the energy flow diagram in an ecosystem.</p>
