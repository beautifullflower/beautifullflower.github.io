<p>Pretty raised beds made out of pavers. Garden Paver border designs protect plants and flowers. I knew i wanted a flower bed along the curve for some gardenias, as well as perennial herbs. Mark out the levels for the road base. Use interlocking, heavy pavers to provide the strongest walls. Starting at one end, begin laying your pavers next to each other. A flower bed filled with perennials is just the thing for blooms that last the entire summer then return year after year.</p>

After you have completed a small section, place a wood board across of it and gently hit it with a hammer to embed the bricks in the dirt and level them with each other.
