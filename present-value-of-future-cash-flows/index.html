<p>Are We Intimidated By Decision Making? Obedience quotes In this video, we explore what is meant by a discount rate and how to calculated a discounted cash flow by expanding our analysis of present value. Present value, a concept based on time value of money, states that a sum of money today is worth much more than the same sum of money in the future and is calculated by dividing the future cash flow by one plus the discount rate raised to the number of periods. The current stock price is the sum of the present value of all future cash flows. This means the money the project is generating in the future is greater than the initial investment of $9,000. The present value of the projected cash flows is $13,266.84. Npv(10,0,{100,200,300,400,500}) we find that the present value is $1,065.26.</p>

<p>Bee Business Bee Investment Appraisal Net Present Value Discounted cash flows are a way of valuing a future stream of cash flows using a discount rate. Net present value, or npv, expresses the value of a series of future cash flows in today’s dollars. To better understand the idea, let�s dig a little deeper into the math. It means that the money you are expecting in a year�s time could be of less value, had you received it today; So here rs 110 is the future value of rs 100 at 10%. This means the money the project is generating in the future is greater than the initial investment of $9,000.</p>
