<p>Gene flow, also called admixture or migration (in reference to people), is the exchange of genetic material between populations (miller 2011). Gene flow occurs when individuals move into or out of a population. Population movements can result in a trait pattern of highest frequency where the population originated and decreasing frequency with greater distance from the ancestral home. It can occur naturally or intentionally. This can change the frequency of genes in both populations.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-widely-accepted-that-speciation-requires-an-interruption-of-gene-flow-between-populations">It is widely accepted that speciation requires an interruption of gene flow between populations:</h3><p>This change is due to four different processes: Initial commensalism followed by direct human involvement/control and resultant selection ( 10 ). This can change the frequency of genes in both populations. The allele frequencies of both the population they leave and the population they enter may change.

<p>Pin on Horizontal gene transfer In population genetics, gene flow (also known as gene migration or allele flow) is the transfer of genetic material from one population to another. In population genetics, gene flow (also known as gene migration or allele flow) is the transfer of genetic material from one population to another. Soldiers had children in southeast asia with vietnamese women during the war there in the 1960. As the offspring mate with the offspring of others, more genes are passed down and spread to more people. Among living organisms, species and populations/ groups of populations capable of interbreeding and producing fertile viable offspring. The exchange of genetic material between populations of the same species through direct or indirect interbreeding.</p>

Species change all of the time Gene flow introduces new genetic material into a population while genetic drift is the way random chance changes a population�s genetics over time. Gene flow is the exchange genes between populations, between same species. The other two forces are mutation and natural. The quality of being diverse genetically.</p>

While migrating animals often carry new alleles from one population to another, they must interbreed with the new population for gene flow to occur. If the rate of gene flow is high enough, then two populations will have equivalent allele frequencies and therefore can be considered a single effective population. Migration into and out of the population change the allele frequencies and induce variations. Gene flow, which can also be described as migration, is a common occurrence with both plants and animals. Microevolution is the change in allele frequencies that occurs over time within a population.</p>

For humans, gene flow generally occurs when people move from one location to another; As the offspring mate with the offspring of others, more genes are passed down and spread to more people. A mutation occurs when a dna gene is damaged or changed in such a way as to alter the genetic message carried by that gene. Genetic drift is the role of chance in evolution.

It is widely accepted that speciation requires an interruption of gene flow between populations: Soldiers had children in southeast asia with vietnamese women during the war there in the 1960. Genetic drift is the role of chance in evolution. When people travel to another area and successfully mate with people in the population there, a transfer of genes occurs between the populations even though the traveler returns home. While genetic drift can result in a decrease in genetic diversity in a population, gene flow can increase.</p>

Population movements can result in a trait pattern of highest frequency where the population originated and decreasing frequency with greater distance from the ancestral home. Gene flow is a term that describes mechanisms of gene transfer from one population to another. However, in the modern world it is not out of the realm of possibility that someone’s genetic material could move with the actual human being leaving their hometown.
