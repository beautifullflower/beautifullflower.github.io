By applying the right amount of external pressure to an extremity, it�s possible to maintain arterial inflow while occluding venous outflow distal to the occlusion site. You don�t need costly implements to perform bfr. Bfr involves wearing a pressure cuff or device to restrict blood flow to your working limb, says sam becourtney , physical therapist at bespoke treatments in new york city. Bfr is the brief and intermittent occlusion of arterial and venous blood flow using a tourniquet while at rest or exercising. Training with blood flow restriction (bfr) can increase muscle strength and may offer an effective clinical musculoskeletal (msk) rehabilitation tool.</p>
