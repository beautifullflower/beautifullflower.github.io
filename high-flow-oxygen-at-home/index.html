High flow concentrators (&gt;8l) high flow concentrators (&gt;8l) hi flow oxygen concentrators we supply several manufacturers hi flow oxygen concentrators, machines with a greater flow than the conventional 5 litres per minute, up to a maximum of 12 litres per minute for medical oxygen concentrators. By providing flow rates of up to 60 lpm, high molecular humidity, and precise oxygen delivery, hfo may reduce the need for noninvasive ventilation and intubation in selected patient populations.

Portable concentrators can’t be high flow because they need to be small enough to carry around comfortably. The oxygen flow meter is attached to an oxygen blender and gas analyser, which makes sure that precise oxygen delivery is being given to the patient. Benificial for patients with humidification. The airvo 2 system features a humidifier with integrated flow source that comfortably delivers high flows of air/oxygen mixtures to spontaneously breathing patients, through the unique optiflow™ nasal interface.</p>

In addition, high flow oxygen therapy ensures high fio2. Bird™ blenders have been the blenders of choice for more than 30 years. While the highest settings that pocs have are 3 lpm and 196 ml/min of pulse dose oxygen. It provides the strongest oxygen outlet pressure in a range from 10 to 30 psi. The other advantage of delivering high flow oxygen through a nasal cannula is to continuously flush out the upper airway dead space by better co2 clearance.</p>
