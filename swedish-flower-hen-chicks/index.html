<p>Swedish Flower Hens are a coollooking landrace from The breed was close to extinction in the 1970s, however a few enthusiasts found an adequate amount of survivors to create a sufficient gene pool, to thankfully ensure the continuation of the breed. Today, about a thousand swedish flower hens live in about fifty scattered flocks, and until greenfire farms began working with this breed, few if any could be found outside remote villages in sweden. The swedish flower hen is one of the traditional breeds of sweden—as well as the largest native chicken to sweden—and was most likely used for both meat and egg production. They are a great dual purpose bird that lays an egg a day and gets to a heavy weight. The swedish flower hen is said to be a confident, calm and poised bird.
