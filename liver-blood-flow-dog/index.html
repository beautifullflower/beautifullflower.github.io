<p>Natura Petz Kick Start My Heart Probiotic Cardiovascular In an average sized dog liver, blood flows at an approximate rate of 240cm 3 /min through the portal vein root, and at a rate of 390cm 3 /min through the hepatic vein root. In all six dogs reduction in portal blood flow was produced by constriction of a single snare sited between the flow probe and the hilum of the liver. Splenic blood flow was recalculated in ml/min/kg body weight. With the exception of man, antipyrine intrinsic clearance was also directly proportional to liver weight. It helps with the process of blood clotting and digestion. Figure 4.2 experimental arrangement for measuring liver blood flow in the dog with electromagnetic flow probes.</p>
