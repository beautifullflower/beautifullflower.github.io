As in other vertebrates, the circulatory system of fish is comprised of both static and dynamic components. The oxygenated blood then flows back to the heart. The heart is the driving force behind the entire circulatory system. Flow of blood between the heart and the cells of the entire body.</p>

<p>Coronary Circulation Pathway no signaling pathway From where it returns as deoxygenated blood to the right auricle, which sends it to the right ventricle, which sends it out to the lungs. The human circulatory system consists of vessels, muscles and organs that help and control the flow of the blood and lymph around the body. Blood then flows from both upper atrium�s (left atrium and right atrium) into the two lower chambers (left and right ventricles) which then expand. From where it returns as deoxygenated blood to the right auricle, which sends it to the right ventricle, which sends it out to the lungs. The circulatory system is a major organ system of the body. Pulmonary circuit and systemic circuit.</p>

<p>Circulation of blood through the heart (diagram) School Blood circulation begins when the heart relaxes between heart beats. It is collectively composed of the cardiovascular system and the lymphatic system with the heart, arteries, capillaries, veins and the blood being the main parts. This demonstration shows the steps in the pathway that blood takes while circulating through the heart, lungs and body. Blood then flows from both upper atrium�s (left atrium and right atrium) into the two lower chambers (left and right ventricles) which then expand. The human heart has four chambers: It enables blood, oxygen and other nutrients to flow around the body.</p>

<p>Systemic and Pulmonary Circulations Human anatomy and Path of blood flow humans, like all vertebrates, have a closed circulatory system. Lymph is essentially recycled excess blood plasma after it has been filtered from the interstitial fluid and returned to The circulatory system works with which other body system to supply the. “vascular” part refers to your blood… The dynamic part is the blood, with all its constituent parts that flows continuously around the fish’s body.
