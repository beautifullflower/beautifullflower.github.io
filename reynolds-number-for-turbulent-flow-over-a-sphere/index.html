The prandtl numbers should be in the range between 0.6 and 2000 for the formula to be valid. For this problem, we will be looking at reynolds number of 1.14e6.

But does not become fully turbulent before the reynolds number reaches much higher values, typically around 3 × 10. The reynolds number will be low for small objects, low velocities, and high viscosity fluids. The flow lines are straight and uniform in the free stream far in front of the sphere, but they are deflected as they pass around the sphere. At reynolds numbers between about 2000 and 4000 the flow is unstable as a result of the onset of turbulence.</p>

For example, consider the flow over a vehicle at a given velocity. Turbulent flow at reynolds number 50,000 around a sphere with trip wire placed 75 from the frontal stagnation point is investigated using detached eddy simulation (des). The point of separation is at first close to the rear of the sphere, and separation results in the formation of a ring eddy attached to the rear surface of the sphere. It is dominated by inertial forces and is characterized with chaotic eddies, vortices, and other flow instabilities.

The prandtl numbers should be in the range between 0.6 and 2000 for the formula to be valid. We then calculate the reynolds number to develop the strategies for solving the problem. For the flow past a smooth cylinder or sphere of diameter d or through a smooth tube with diameter d we have (approximately) reynolds number = (density * d * flow speed) / viscosity. Reynolds number can be defined for a number of different situations where a fluid is in relative motion to a surface.

The first thing to note is that for these very small reynolds numbers the flow pattern is symmetrical front to back. At re = 3700 , the separating shear layer persists downstream to form a cylindrical vortex sheet and its instability becomes manifest at x ≈ 2 d.
