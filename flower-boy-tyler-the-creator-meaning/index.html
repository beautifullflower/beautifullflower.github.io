The two had previously collaborated on songs “keep da o’s and “ifhy”. The overall story of tyler, the creator�s newest album, igor, is something many have lived through. Tyler, the creator is no stranger to the multiple lives a story can take on. Tyler may not have earned forgiveness for his past, which he will rightfully continue to be judged by, but flower boy is the first time he�s earned the right to penance.</p>

<p>Pin by j on tyler &amp; rocky Tyler the creator, Dreamy But on “where this flower blooms,” he does position himself as a kind of role model, promising to “tell these black kids they could be who they are.” That tyler has established himself as a video director (not to mention festival entrepreneur, and photobook and media app creator) has furthered the sense of a renaissance man amusing himself. Tyler hasn’t exactly transformed into kendrick lamar. His reference to the black lives matter movement on flower boy’s opening track, “foreword,” is just that—a passing reference, not necessarily a sign of emerging political consciousness. This song also has additional vocals provided by tyler’s mentor and inspiration pharrell. “don’t go into this expecting a rap album,” he wrote.</p>
