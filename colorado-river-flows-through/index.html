It is approximately 1,450 miles (2,334 km) in length and it drains an area of about 246,000 square miles (637,000 sq km). The pulse flow is intended to mimic the way the colorado river flowed in the springtime, thanks to snowmelt from the rocky mountains, before dams were built and water diverted towards agricultural fields and municipal users. Each entering river and each lateral creek has cut another canyon, and thus the upper and middle parts of the colorado basin are traversed by a labyrinth of deep gorges. The longest of these unbroken trunk canyons through which the colorado flows is the spectacular grand canyon, extending from the mouth of the paria to the grand wash stream.
