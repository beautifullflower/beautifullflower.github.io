<p>Yellow Boutonnieres with Lambs Ear Yellow and Gray We don�t have lamb�s ears in our yard, but there are some in the learning garden area of the community center, and in maggie�s yard, and at the botanical garden (where i took a picture of their name tag), and a lot of places around here. Lamb�s ear (stachys byzantina) is primarily grown for its soft, fuzzy oval foliage. It doesn�t seem to mind heavy clay soil and hot, dry conditions.
