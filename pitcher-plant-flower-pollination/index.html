<p><strong>Pitcher Plant Flower Pollination</strong>, To successfully pollinate nepenthes, you must have a flowering female plant and either a flowering male plant or stored pollen. The traps at the end of the leaf vary greatly in color, shape, and size between the many different species. The tropical pitcher plant, or nepenthes, is a highly complex and refined bug catcher.</p>

<p>The pollination ecology of darlingtonia californica torr., including especially the identity of its pollinators, has remained enigmatic for more than a century.

Nectar is used as a “bribe” to attract insects so that pollen grains will be stuck onto insects’ bodies for pollination to take place. Only a few flowers in a cluster are in bloom at any one time. Pollination occurs when pollen is moved within flowers or carried from flower to flower by wind, water, or pollinating animals. The leaves are often tinged or veined with purple, and can grow to 30 cm in length.</p>

The genus belongs to the family sarraceniaceae, which also contain the closely allied genera darlingtonia and heliamphora. Pollinating nepenthes is a little more difficult than pollinating other cps, such as sarracenia or drosera, because tropical pitcher plants are dioecious.this means that there are separate male and female plants;</p>

To successfully pollinate nepenthes, you must have a flowering female plant and either a flowering male plant or stored pollen. A pitcher plant is designed to be pollinated by pollen stuck to the body of the insect before the insect descends onto the lower platform section of the style, where it crawls around gathering nectar, and inadvertently, pollen.</p>
