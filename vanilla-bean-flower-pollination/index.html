<p>Vanilla Orchid for Sabor Journal on Bechance. Watercolor Irrigation should be stopped during the month of december and the tips of the vines should be pruned. These beans, if properly treated, give off the flavor we now associate with vanilla. ¿where does the vanilla comes from? Once a bean is harvested, it goes through an extensive process to produce the vanilla bean used for baking. Typically, the hand pollination of vanilla plants will take place between the months of october and january. The flowers typically appear during the drier times of year and are triggered by the lack of rainfall.</p>

<p>Vanilla pompona pollination Vanilla plant, Pollination Even today, the vast majority of the world�s vanilla beans are grown through hand pollination. The continuing bloom gives time for trial and error in the effort to pollinate the flowers for vanilla beans. The vanilla orchid produces bean pods between october through march, a good quality pod must be at least 6 inches long. You will know the bean is mature when the bean begins to yellow on the end connected to the vine. Hand pollination sounds like a lot of work. This research aimed to evaluate the quality of vanilla fruit at 224, 252 and 273 days after pollination, and its relationship with the aroma profile of cured vanilla.</p>
