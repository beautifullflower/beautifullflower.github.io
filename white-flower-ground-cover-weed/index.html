This moss is not a moss at all, but is named so because it looks and spreads so much like it. Consider this one of the easier perennial ground covers, namely because it can bloom in partial shade with moist soil. A high quality ground cover will suppress the growth of weeds, while at the same time providing sufficient drainage for the soil underneath, so that it stays moist and nourished. Its bicolored leaves are green and white, but the white part is strong enough to create an overall impression of brightness. If you don’t, it’s a weed.</p>
