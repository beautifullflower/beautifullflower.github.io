<!--html tag code -->
<p><strong>Ovary Of A Flower Develops Into</strong>, The ovary contains one or more ovules, which develop into seeds upon fertilization. The ovary in angiosperms develops into the fruit whereas the ovules become the seeds enclosed within the fruit. In the hairy banana, the ovary grows into a banana that is full of seeds and is not edible.</p>

<p>After fertilization, an ovule develops into a seed and the surrounding ovary usually develops into a fruit. It maybe dry or fleshy and maybe dehiscent or indehiscent. Herein, how is a seed formed? While we tend to think of fruits as being sweet, biologically a fruit is any structure that develops from an ovary after fertilization. Ovules in the ovary develop into seed.</p>
