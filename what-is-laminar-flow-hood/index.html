<p>Air science ® laminar flow hoods are a series of high efficiency products designed to protect equipment and other contents of the work zone from particulates, for applications sensitive to such contamination. Due to the direction of air flow, the sample is protected from the user but the user is not protected from the sample. Building a flow hood step by step building this laminar low hood can be broken down into 5 basic steps: Constructing the filter housing the ilter housing is the main structure of the low hood.
