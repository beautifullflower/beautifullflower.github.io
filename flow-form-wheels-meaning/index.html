<p><strong>Flow Form Wheels Meaning</strong>, Since few years ago when we released the 1st 19 inch flow form wheel for the canadian market, the idea of designing the lightest possible 18 inch wheels for competition/track use had always been brought up and discussed at team superspeed. This allows you, the consumer to have a wheel that is uncompromised in style and performance while still being.
