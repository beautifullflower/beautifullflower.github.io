Arteries begin with the aorta, the large artery leaving the heart. Blood flow is the movement of blood through a vessel, tissue, or organ. Every time the heart beats, it pushes blood out into the body, and the blood is forced through a series of valves to reach the extremities before returning to the heart. Clotting can prevent us from bleeding to death and protect us from the entry of bacteria and viruses. Beginning with the superior and inferior vena cavae and the coronary sinus, the flowchart below summarizes the flow of blood through the heart, including all arteries, veins, and valves that are passed along the way.</p>

It�s vital that blood clots when we have a surface injury that breaks blood vessels. Clotting can prevent us from bleeding to death and protect us from the entry of bacteria and viruses. Its pumping power also pushes blood through organs like the lungs to remove waste products like co2.; When the ventricles are filled with blood, the tricuspid valves close. The guidelines now state that blood normal blood pressure is 120/80 mmhg.</p>
