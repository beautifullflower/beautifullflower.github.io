<p>Pin by Melina Hartley on caBBage pAtch இڿڰۣڰۣ Is a cabbage a flower? Flowering cabbage is easily grown from seed but must be started by midsummer to be ready for fall planting. You do not want the soil too wet, however, because it can rot the plant. Here is what they are: Cabbages that experience hard freezes won’t store as well, though, so harvest before temps dip below 28ºf if you plan to store heads in a refrigerator or root cellar for any length of time. Typically, established cabbage plants need 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week—supplied through rainfall or irrigation.</p>

Cabbage flowers and kale flowers are very similar, but kale flowers have fringed (ruffled), serrated, or feathered edges on the leaves while cabbage flowers have smooth edges on the leaves. Cabbages that experience hard freezes won’t store as well, though, so harvest before temps dip below 28ºf if you plan to store heads in a refrigerator or root cellar for any length of time.
