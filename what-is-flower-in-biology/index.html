Flower is a specialized condensed shoot of an angiospermic plant in which the shoot apical meristem gets transformed into floral meristem for carrying out sexual reproduction through progressive specialisation of leaves into floral appendages. During the bud stage, the calyx functions by protecting the flower by enclosing the complete flower. The vegetative shoot shows unlimited growth, whereas the flower shows the limited growth.
