<p><strong>Define Gene Flow In Short</strong>, New gene combinations are made possible by the availability of new alleles in the gene pool. The new alleles that areentering the population will usually come from another population,and/or populations will be trading alleles with each other.

<p>Gene flow is the exchange of genes between two separate populations. It acts as both an on/off switch to control when proteins are made and also a volume control that increases or decreases the amount of proteins made. One (sigaus australis) widespread and the other (sigaus childi) a narrow endemic. Gene expression is a tightly regulated process that allows a cell to respond to its changing environment.

One (sigaus australis) widespread and the other (sigaus childi) a narrow endemic. If the rate of gene flow is high enough, then two populations will have equivalent allele frequencies and therefore can be considered a single effective population. Microevolution is the change in allele frequencies that occurs over time within a population. Gene flow is traditionally considered a limitation to speciation because selection is required to counter the homogenising effect of allele exchange.</p>
