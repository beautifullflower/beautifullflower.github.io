<p>After the starting point the curve rapidly mounts to a peak: Spirometry measures the rate at which the lung changes volume during forced breathing maneuvers. Spirometry begins with a full inhalation, followed by a forced expiration that rapidly empties the. Cpt 94010 is included in this procedure. This test requires the patient to make a maximal inspiratory and expiratory effort.</p>
<h3 id="at-the-start-of-the-test-both-flow-and-volume-are-equal-to-zero">At the start of the test both flow and volume are equal to zero.</h3><p>The inspiratory part of the loop is shaped like a half circle. Modem microprocessor controlled recording spirometers automatically generate these flow volume loops. How is a flow volume. This test requires the patient to make a maximal inspiratory and expiratory effort. The values of the parameters are higher than 80% of the predicted values, while the tiffeneau index (fev1/fvc*100) is higher than 70.</p>

Cpt 94010 and 94375 are bundled with cpt 94060. The location of the airway obstruction can also be identified from the shape of the flow volume loop. Expiratory portion of the flow volume loop is characterized by a rapid rise to the peak flow rate, followed by a near linear fall in flow as the patient exhales toward residual volume. At the start of the test both flow and volume are equal to zero.</p>
