<p>Pin by Sandy Donley on Picture Plants, Pictures I wanted to share this exciting news with all of you. While a zz left completely on its own in a dark closet will eventually falter and fail, it is much less fussy and more tolerant of poor treatment than most other houseplants. Fourth, their blooming stage isn�t all that long so you can tell before picking if they will produce another bud. The zz plant is perhaps one of the hardiest plants around. Take your zz plant leaf cuttings from mature stems. The species is also sometimes known by the synonyms zamioculcas loddigesii, zamiacaulcas zamiafolia, zamioculcas lanceolata, and strangely caladium zamiaefolium but the common names are aroid palm, arum fern, money plant, or simply zz plant.</p>

<p>Pin by The Sill on Pots, Planters, &amp; Vessels Plants I bought this plant in the early spring and had it growing under my grow lights for a while. It’s in the araceae, or arum family, the same plant family as the familiar houseplant peace lily (spathiphyllum cochlearispathum). It does happen on occasion though, particularly as things get colder and winter arrives all of which will result in zz plant yellow leaves appearing. Take your zz plant leaf cuttings from mature stems. Check for roots and rhizome formation after a month. Place in a warm area with bright light during the day.</p>

<p>Pin by Chantel Mysliwiec on sitios con mucho color The zz plant gets its common name from the scientific name zamioculcas zamiifolia engl. Having evolved in drier conditions than most other aroids, th Zamioculcas zamiifolia is native to east africa, from kenya to south africa. Zamioculcas (common names zanzibar gem, zz plant, zuzu plant, aroid palm, eternity plant or emerald palm) is a genus of flowering plant in the family araceae, containing the single species zamioculcas zamiifolia. I did find this article which debunks myths and explains the zamioculcas zamiifolia is a plant from east africa growing not in deserts, but in shady forested areas. Including one poking through the exposed rhizome!.</p>
