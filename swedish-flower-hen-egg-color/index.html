<p>Sweedish Flower Chicken Swedish flower hen, Hens, Hen An adult hen generally weighs between 2 to 2.5kg, they are very hardy specimens. About 1/3 hens will go broody if allowed. You can check our other post about what are the best egg laying chicken breeds. If you are interested in raising and preserving breeds of poultry, this is a great place to start since there is no formal standard for breeding and hatching the chicks always brings excitement in the colors you will see. Rather like a bouquet of flowers: Swedish flower hens are called blommeh??ns in swedish;</p>

<p>Swedish Flower Chickens have tons of diversity to them The egg color is a light beige tint. The swedish flower hen, swedish: The swedish flower hen my pet chicken makes great mothers when allowed to be broody, but are not known to broody excessively. The hens are good mothers when allowed to be broody, but are not known to be obsessively broody. The feather pattern is mille fleur (thousand flowers), the feathers are white tipped. Swedish flower hens emerged as a landrace several hundred years ago, the product of a now forgotten mix of primitive breeds that were brought to sweden by settlers and conquerors.</p>

The swedish flower hen lays cream colored eggs that vary from large to jumbo. You can expect beige/brown colored eggs that are a decent size. The swedish flower hen was relatively unknown until the early 2000s. Unlike many breeds that are recognized by the apa and have a standard of perfection look, swedish flower hens come in all sorts of colors and color patterns and make, thereby, a more interesting and prettier flock, in my humble and clearly biased opinion. There are birds that lay eggs a lot more frequently than this, but none of them look as beautiful as the swedish flower hen while doing so!</p>

<p>Two beautifully colored young Aloha Chicken pullets at On average, the chicken will lay between 150 and 200 eggs each year or about three to four eggs each week. Some of the birds have a slight crest at the top of their heads and others do not. From the greenfire farms website: Blue (bbs) laced red wyandotte: That�s just the literal translation of the swedish breed name. They are known and named for their flowers or white lacing on the tips of their feathers.</p>
