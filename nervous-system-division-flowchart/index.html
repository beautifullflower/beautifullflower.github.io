<p>anatomic differences in sympathetic and parasympathetic The motor division of the pns is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system (ans) controls the activities of organs, glands, and various involuntary muscles, such as cardiac and smooth muscles. Nervous system has neurons sensory neurons interneurons are made up of motor neurons central nervous system consists of peripheral nervous system motor neurons contains receptors such as pain receptors mechano receptors chemo receptors thermo receptors photo receptors comprise the somatic nervous system autonomic nervous system parasympathetic division is divided into sympathetic division controls fight or flight rest or digest controls spinal cord includes the signals to and from the brain. It functions largely below the level of consciousness, and controls visceral functions. The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body, then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events.[1] nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago.
