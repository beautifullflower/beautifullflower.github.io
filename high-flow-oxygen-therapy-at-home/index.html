<p><strong>High Flow Oxygen Therapy At Home</strong>, Especially in warmer climates it is a big limitation. High flow oxygen therapy (hfnc) is a kind of oxygen therapy that directly transports a certain oxygen concentration of air oxygen mixed with high flow gas to patients through a soft nasal cannula.

Does anybody know any way to get ‘high flow oxygen equipment’ (as they have in hospitals) at home for end stage emphysema. It is used in acute and chronic breathing problems, and is a suitable choice for treatment of patients with s For each liter per minute of oxygen flow, about 3% to 4% is added to the oxygen concentration. Traditional oxygen therapy is up to 16 l/min and high flow oxygen therapy is up to 60 l/min.</p>

High flow oxygen therapy is a form of respiratory support used in the hospital where oxygen, often in conjunction with compressed air and humidification, is delivered to a patient at rates of flow higher than that delivered traditionally in oxygen therapy. It provides the strongest oxygen outlet pressure in a range from 10 to 30 psi. High flow oxygen therapy (hfnc) is a kind of oxygen therapy that directly transports a certain oxygen concentration of air oxygen mixed with high flow gas to patients through a soft nasal cannula. High flow oxygen therapy is usually delivered using a blender connected to a wall outlet, a humidifier, heated tubing and nasal cannula.</p>

Nhf means nasal application of heated and humidified air oxygen mixture with a flow up to 60lpm containing a varying proportion of oxygen up to 90%, depending on the oxygen flow provided. As we all need a certain amount of oxygen in our blood to function properly, if blood oxygen levels are low, the cells in our tissues don�t behave as effectively for us to operate normally.

As we all need a certain amount of oxygen in our blood to function properly, if blood oxygen levels are low, the cells in our tissues don�t behave as effectively for us to operate normally. By providing flow rates of up to 60 lpm, high molecular humidity, and precise oxygen delivery, hfo may reduce the need for noninvasive ventilation and intubation in selected patient populations.
