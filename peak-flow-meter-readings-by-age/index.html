<p><strong>Peak Flow Meter Readings By Age</strong>, A peak flow meter is a portable device that measures your peak expiratory flow rate (pefr)—that is, how quickly your lungs expel air during a forceful exhalation after you fully inhale. Peak flow monitoring is not recommended for children under 12 years. Regular use of a peak flow meter can help keep tabs on your asthma by detecting airway narrowing even before you feel any symptoms, giving you time to adjust your medication or take other steps before your symptoms get worse.</p>

When peak flow is being monitored regularly, the results may be recorded on a peak flow chart. Here is the peak flow calculator used to calculate normal flow rate values using the person�s height, age and measured peak flow. Peak flow measurement can show the amount and rate of air that can be forcefully breathed out of the lungs.</p>

<p>About Me Testimonial about HayFever, Allergic Rhinitis To help diagnose asthma, your result can be compared to what would usually be expected for someone of your age, height and gender. For example, a 30 year old male that is 5�10’’ tall should have a reading close to 622 liters per minute. It is used to measure the rate at which you can exhale out after a deep inspiration peak flow value also helps to know the degree of obstruction in your airway and how well you are responding to your asthma treatment The expected values are higher in younger people, taller people and men. Normal readings of peak flow meters depend on a person’s age, sex, and height. A peak flow meter is a portable device that measures your peak expiratory flow rate (pefr)—that is, how quickly your lungs expel air during a forceful exhalation after you fully inhale.</p>
