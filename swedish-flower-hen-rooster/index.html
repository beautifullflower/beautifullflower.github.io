<p>Swedish flower chickens Crested Swedish Flower Hen Some birds will have floppy combs whilst others will have less floppy combs. The enticing colorful swedish flower hens (skånsk blommehöna) are certainly that. Swedish flower is on my wish list. With the commercialization of sweden’s poultry flocks in the last half of the 20th century, this breed almost became extinct. I am working on creating isabella (lavender partridge) crele, and lavender crele brahmas of high quality. I believe the girl is the one with the grey back as she is pictured below at 2 months.</p>

With the commercialization of sweden’s poultry flocks in the last half of the 20th century, this breed almost became extinct. In body type they look like those old farm breeds that were good layers but with enough meat to make them useful candidates for the stew pot. The swedish flower hen is one of the traditional breeds of sweden—as well as the largest native chicken to sweden—and was most likely used for both meat and egg production.</p>
