The kidneys usually completely filter creatinine from the blood. Too much cholesterol can clog the renal arteries and prevent normal blood flow to the kidneys, resulting in loss of kidney function. Urinalysis is the first test done.</p>

A person with low kidney function is at risk for kidney disease, according to the national kidney foundation. Urinalysis can detect blood (confirming that the red color of the urine is caused by blood) and may show evidence of a kidney filtering disorder.
