<p>How To Protect Cucumber Plants From Beetles And Powdery The reason behind the common name ‘four o’clock plant’, is that according to legend, it can be best viewed at four o’clock in the afternoon, when the flowers typically open (flora of india, 2015; The leaves of four o�clocks lure japanese beetles in a kind of fatal attraction. the japanese beetles are drawn by the scent and poisoned by the leaves. I read in a seed catalog that 4:00 flowers (aka marvel of peru) will attract japanese beetles who will eat part of the plant and then, because the plant is very toxic to them, die. Good trap plants are four o’clocks (poisonous), larkspur (poisonous), castor bean (poisonous), borage, marigolds, light colored zinnias, and white roses. Plant four o’clocks nearby and lure the predators away! They die to the ground in winter.</p>

<p>It�s not always simple to be an organic gardener. Even A later bulletin in 1963 upgraded the plant to one “lightly or moderately” eaten by japanese beetles. This one is bred for its flowers. This highly poisonous genus needs to be kept high and out of reach of children and animals. In searching for organic ways to control (or better yet, eradicate) japanese beetles in my garden, i found multiple claims in various internet forums and websites concerning the plants commonly known as four o’clocks (mirabilis jalapa). Japanese beetle here’s a list of the plants japanese beetles like best. This year they are eating things like lilies that they never bothered before.</p>
