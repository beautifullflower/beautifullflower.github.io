This is a very significant difference in two specific training goals: The cuff is placed on the injured arm or leg. It is inflated to a specific pressure intermittently to reduce blood flow to the area of the body. Blood flow restriction training can be used for general strengthening, especially in certain populations such as the elderly. Bfr technology minimizes the effects of limited extremity use, shortens rehab time, and has been shown to enhance outcomes.</p>

The cuff is inflated, reducing blood flow to the limb. Blood flow restriction, or bfr, is the brief and intermittent occlusion or restriction of arterial and venous blood flow that is performed by applying a cuff to the upper or lower extremity. By restricting blood flow, the muscles aren’t required to work as hard (with as little as 20% of the resistance required without bfr) in order to strengthen muscles. Using this technique, you can exercise using a significantly less weight and achieve significant gains in muscle strength and size.</p>
