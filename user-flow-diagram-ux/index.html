<p>UX Template Speech Bubble User Flow User Journey Template User flow is a type of diagram used in ux design. A schematic notion of all the possible interactions will be provided to you by user flow tools. It is a tool created to improve the product user experience and it is also a good tool to show developers how the product works. Task flow is a single flow completed similarly by all users for a specific action. The user flow lays out the user’s movement through the product, mapping out each and every step the user takes—from entry point right through to the final interaction. Next up in our web and mobile development tutorial series, here we�ll examine the process of moving from a user interface spec to the construction of a flow chart that describes the detailed user experience (ux) through the app.</p>

To create more enjoyable ux, a website/app is designed with different user flows for the same or diverse user goals.</p>
