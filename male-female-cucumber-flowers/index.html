Gynoecious species of cucumber produces only female flowers. The male blooms on cucumber and zucchini plants serve two purposes. Because one male flower can pollinate 3 or 5 female flowers at a go. Just about all vegetable crops that grow on a vine,,ie cucumber pumpkin melons, produce most of their female flowers on laterals,, especially pumpkins,, so what you have to do is snip the end out of the runners which will create laterals and produce female flowers,, if your main runners 3 foot long donï¿½t be scared to cut a foot off each of them</p>
