In such cases, up to 10% of the seeds will be a pollinator variety that produces male flowers.

Gynoecious species of cucumber produces only female flowers. The male blooms on cucumber and zucchini plants serve two purposes. Because one male flower can pollinate 3 or 5 female flowers at a go. Just about all vegetable crops that grow on a vine,,ie cucumber pumpkin melons, produce most of their female flowers on laterals,, especially pumpkins,, so what you have to do is snip the end out of the runners which will create laterals and produce female flowers,, if your main runners 3 foot long don�t be scared to cut a foot off each of them</p>

Male cucumber flowers are found on shorter stems, and grow in clusters of 3 to 5. The male flowers just have a stalk connecting them to the plant, often thinner than the female. Melons, cucumbers and squash are monoecious meaning they produce both male and female flowers on the same plant. Do you pick the flowers off cucumber plants. Correspondingly, are there male and female cucumber plants?</p>
