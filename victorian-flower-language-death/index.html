The victorian flower language, also known as ‘floriography’, was a secret floral code by means of which lovers could exchange messages without the embarrassment of having to indiscreetly ask or tell someone the nature of one’s true heart’s desire. It tells you exactly what plant you should send someone to convey an emotion, and obviously most of them are about love and compliments. Those 60 years were some of the most stable and peaceful years the island had experienced for centuries, so culture began to shift towards more intellectual and artistic pursuits. The language of flowers, which is sometimes referred to as floriography, have been used as a means of cryptological communication by using varieties of flowers and their arrangement. The messages were decoded with the aid of flower dictionaries.</p>

<p>A girl is like a flower Girls be like, Words, Feelings The language of flowers, which is sometimes referred to as floriography, have been used as a means of cryptological communication by using varieties of flowers and their arrangement. The craze for the victorian flower language finds its roots in ottoman turkey, in particular in turkish “selam”. When john everett millais painted the doomed ophelia of shakespeare’s hamlet, he gave her all the flowers of the original text in the lush scene of death. It was during the victorian era that a large list of meanings was assigned to flowers and the language of flowers came into being. Dating back to the victorian times floriography was used as a means of coded communication through various flowers and floral arrangements, allowing people to express feelings which otherwise could not be spoken. The messages were decoded with the aid of flower dictionaries.</p>

<p>Today�s Feature Flower Chrysanthemum! In the Victorian Taken from the illustrated language of flowers. In a sort of silent dialogue, flowers could be used to answer “yes” or “no” questions. The iconic sir john everett millais painting of ophelia, floating in a river of flowers moments before her drowning, coalesces the plants of hamlet with the victorian language of flowers. If the left hand was used, the answer was “no.”. Those 60 years were some of the most stable and peaceful years the island had experienced for centuries, so culture began to shift towards more intellectual and artistic pursuits. This is known as florigraphy, the language of flowers.</p>

For victorians, flowers were the language of love. You will be my death.</p>
