<p>Blood flows from the left atrium into the left ventricle through the open mitral valve. This is called heart failure because of the failure of your heart to pump blood around the body and work efficiently. Blood enters the heart through two large veins the inferior and superior vena cava emptying oxygen poor blood from the body into the right atrium of the heart. At the bottom of the right atrium is the tricuspid valve, which opens when blood is pumped from the right atrium into the right ventricle. Different valves perform different functions.</p>

The mitral valve and tricuspid valve are located between the atria (upper heart chambers) and the ventricles (lower heart chambers). As the ventricle contracts, blood leaves the heart through the pulmonic valve, into the pulmonary artery and to the lungs, where it is oxygenated. This is called the pulmonary circulation.
