<p><strong>Bad Mass Air Flow Sensor Signs</strong>, There are 3 key signs that may indicate it’s time to examine your maf sensor. Depending on the age of your vehicle, map sensor diagnostic trouble codes (dtc) may range from simple circuit, or sensor faults, to correlation, or range faults. A change in the reading indicates a bad connector, which then has to be replaced.</p>

<p>When the device goes bad, it can lead to various symptoms, ranging from an illuminated check engine light to rough running and misfiring. Signs of a failing mass air flow sensor your mass air flow sensor (maf sensor) is a piece of technology within your engine which tells your car’s computer how much air is entering the engine. Shake the iat sensor connection to the mass air flow sensor, and check to see if there is any difference in reading. The car will not start due to carbon clogging the sensor; Performance and circuit diagnostic trouble codes may refer directly to the maf sensor, but fuel trim and misfire codes can also be linked to the maf sensor.</p>
