I would recommend agains knowingly planting this species. It is called butter and eggs, because of the similarity of its flower colors to those products, and toadflax, because the orange spot resembles a toad�s mouth and its leaves are similar to those of the flax plant. Occasional wildfires and mowing are not effective in controlling this plant. Commonly seen by pastures, edges of forests, roadsides, lake shores, waste areas, and beach meadows.</p>

<p>Matilija Poppies (aka “Fried Egg Flower”) or Romneya Good for skin and skin problems. Add plants for butterfly caterpillars. While butter and eggs is fairly widespread in minnesota, dalmatian toadflax is just showing up now. Likely originally introduced into north america by gardeners, it is now a highly problematic invasive species throughout the arid western us, spreading aggressively by both seeds and robust underground root stalks. Another pretty face and another invasive species. Each plant can produce up to thirty thousand winged seeds per year, and once established it is difficult to remove.</p>

Yellow toadflax, butter and eggs, wild snapdragon, common toadflax, ramsted, flaxweed, jacob�s ladder. It tends to grow in clumps and spreads vegetatively as well as by seed. Plants may grow as tall as two feet but are often shorter, especially along roadsides.
