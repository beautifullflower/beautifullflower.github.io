<p>Throw Pillow with Removable Flower Accents Throw pillow Choose from simple, quick projects that can be made with scrap yarn, or more elaborate crochet flowers that stand on their own as works of art. The center of the flower is made using the crocodile stitch. Make a bunch of decorative pillows with this simple pattern. The pattern for the pot holder is almost the exact same pattern as the blooming flower cushion made by attic 24 (another favorite pattern of mine!). Cut yarn leaving a long tail to sew the center piece onto the flower. It’s fun, easy and looks great wherever you put it.</p>
