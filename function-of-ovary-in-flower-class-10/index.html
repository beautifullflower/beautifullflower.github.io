The parts of a flower that are often conspicuously colored in order to attract the pollinators like insects. This provides a large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to the embryo, and the developing embryo will also generate waste substances which can be removed by transferring them into the mothers blood through the placenta.
