<p>Be Like Christ in 2020 Christian wallpaper, Christian In 1943, richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein ii had written two musicals in the 1950s that did not do well and sought a new hit to rev 1 flower drum song is a fun nostalgic souvenir of the late 1950s, but its book is not something that will win over modern audiences. Flower drum song holds a special place for me because it was the first broadway show i ever saw. Flower drum song many older musicals go in for a refreshing facelift, but this version of rodgers and hammerstein�s flower drum song, with a spankin� new book by david henry hwang, is a lot. The tale had charm and style but this overblown and overlong movie just lies there and dies there. Flower drum song has been overwhelmed by the sheer opulence and glamour with which ross hunter has translated it to the screen.</p>
