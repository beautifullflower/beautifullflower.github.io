In semiconductors they can be electrons or holes. Conductors correspond to pipes through which the fluid flows. Electric current, (i), is the amount of charge that flows past a particular point per unit of time. It is measured as the net rate of flow of electric charge through a surface or into a control volume. The battery is analogous to a pump, and current is analogous to the fluid.</p>

<p>A A Split 2 Refrigeration and air conditioning, Hvac air An electric current is a stream of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space. Voltage corresponds to the pressure differential between points in the. In semiconductors they can be electrons or holes. The battery is analogous to a pump, and current is analogous to the fluid. Direct current the electricity flows in only one direction (batteries, laptops) d.c. When a voltage is applied the electrons move from one atom to the next along a circuit carrying the electrical charge with them.</p>

<p>Electric circuits. Analogy In the water circuit, the In a parallel circuit the current is. Water current is the rate at which water flows past a point on the water circuit. Analogy to electric resistance the equation above for heat flow is analogous to the relation for electric current flow i , expressed as: Electric current, (i), is the amount of charge that flows past a particular point per unit of time. In electric circuits the charge carriers are often electrons moving through a wire. The more collisions, the greater the resistance to current flow.</p>

<p>Airflow diagram for Aerodyne cyclone in standard vertical The electric current is the flow of charges carried by electrons as they move around the circuit. Water current is the rate at which water flows past a point on the water circuit. The si unit for measuring an electric current is ampere (a) and si unit for electric charge is the coulomb(q). Flow of electrical current in a wire is analogous to the flow of water in a pipe. The thermal conductance in the heat transfer system d. Similarly, the greater the electrical resistance for a given voltage, the less electric current will exist.</p>
