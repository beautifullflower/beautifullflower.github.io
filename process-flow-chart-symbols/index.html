<p><strong>Process Flow Chart Symbols</strong>, Flow chart symbols use different shapes to represent different components, such as equipment, valves, instruments, and piping flow. In fact, if you use other flowcharting shapes, many people won�t know what they are for, so you may want to add a symbol key to your flowchart. The first symbol to be displayed is the arrow, a connection symbol used to indicate a link between two other symbols and the direction of flow.</p>
