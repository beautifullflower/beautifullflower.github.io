A few words of sympathy, acknowledging their loss and maybe offering comfort is all that is needed. They are a beautiful way of creating a personal tribute to a loved one.

Equally, when signing off your message, include your name so that the receiver knows whom the flowers/message are from. Funeral flower arrangements usually come with a small card that already has an expression of sympathy printed on it.</p>
