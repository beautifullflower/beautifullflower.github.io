<p>A peak flow test involves blowing as hard as you can into a small handheld device called a peak flow meter. In some situations, though, peak flow readings may be used when spirometry is normal and asthma is still suspected. Peak expiratory flow is typically measured in units of liters per minute. If you can show your peak flow readings pick up after your blue inhaler, this is pretty diagnostic. A peak flow meter is a portable device that measures your peak expiratory flow rate (pefr)—that is, how quickly your lungs expel air during a forceful exhalation after you fully inhale.</p>
