The description for the flower says that it glows with a pale light, which is usually a sign of something having a connection to the pale king. Delivering the delicate flower unlocks this interaction: You defeat the infection forever; The knight disappears, leaving only a broken mask; The crawler makes an offering to us.</p>

<p>Пин от пользователя Vivi Cipher на доске Hollow Knight • conquering all pantheons • fight to defeat the absolute radiance boss • having given the delicate flower to the godseeker the godseeker and the void disappear leaving only the flower upon the ground with a tinge of black on one of its petals. Of course, all of the godseeker�s die in embrace the void, so it�s a matter of choosing between the hollow knight and the godseekers. The crystal gems, greg, and connie find their �happily ever after� in ruins when steven goes to bed one night and doesn�t wake up. The flowers originate from outside of hallownest from a place known as lands serene. The best ending is the embrace the void with delicate flower. Or does killing broken vessel not trigger the infection, but taking the wings does?</p>

<p>Pin by Gemling Angel on Hollow Knight in 2020 Hollow art Delicate flower is a quest in hollow knight. You dream nail him while he’s down; Unlocking it will reveal the godseeker, an npc and the godtuner item. Hoàn thành nhiệm vụ bằng cách đưa đóa hoa đến ngôi mộ một cách toàn vẹn, rồi quay về chỗ grey mourner, sẽ nhận được phần thưởng là 1 mask shard. When the godseeker hears that gentle voice singing and feels the power radiating from him, the living power, she becomes determined to attune to his strength. After speaking to the grey mourner, the knight will be tasked to deliver this unruined flower to the grave of the traitor�s child in queen�s gardens.</p>

<p>Пин от пользователя Lyudmila Pavlenko на доске Hollow 1 ánh sáng lóe lên, cả the godseeker và các xúc tua hư không biến mất, để lại bông hoa trên mặt đất với một ít dịch màu đen trên cánh hoa. In hallownest, the godseeker gradually wakes up with each pantheon the knight completes. The delicate flower is an item in hollow knight. A powerful and destructive entity, the radiance is the being responsible for ruling the previous hive mind before the creation of hallownest, while also the one responsible for causing the infection as punishment for the bugs abandoning her laws. Quests can provide rewards from items, unlocking trophies/achievements, and uncovering more information to the lore. The first ending is simply gotten by completing the fifth pantheons (linked above).</p>

<p>Сообщество Steam Hollow Knight in 2020 Knight, Hollow Taking the flower to the godseeker unlocks an alternate ending where the godseeker and the void disappear, presumably stopping the void from tearing into hallownest. Leaving only the shining flower to remain. So i have beaten hollow knight to 112% and on my way to beat poh and recently heard that you could give the godseeker the delicate flower for a different ending? Quests can provide rewards from items, unlocking trophies/achievements, and uncovering more information to the lore. Eternal emilitia, nailmaster oro, white lady, and godseeker. • conquering all pantheons • fight to defeat the absolute radiance boss • having given the delicate flower to the godseeker the godseeker and the void disappear leaving only the flower upon the ground with a tinge of black on one of its petals.</p>
