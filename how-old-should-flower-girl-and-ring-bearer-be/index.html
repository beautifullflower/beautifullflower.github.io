For the sake of managing tantrums and expectations much more easily, the safe flower girl age bracket is from three to ten years old. In this arrangement, the eldest child can help to keep younger children on track. As for the age itself, there’s literally no limit.</p>

<p>Asking Flower Girl &amp; Ring Bearer to Be in Your Wedding This can be just before the maid of honor walks down the aisle, or just before the bride takes her walk down the aisle. Of course, sticking to this age range is not only about convenience. The age range for child attendants is typically four to eight years old. According to this etiquette guru, traditionally flower girls and ring bearers should be between the ages of three and eight years old. Or, if you�re having a long train, one can act as a page boy (train bearer) instead. Flower girls should be between the ages of 3 and 7.</p>

<p>Whimsical meets Rustic Garden Wedding in Canada Rustic I was going to have them both be flower girls,and then get someone else to be the ring bearer. My brother is 9 and i think he�s too old to be a ring bearer. The same goes for younger flower girls. If you do choose to have a flower girl and ring bearer as part of your ceremony, make sure that the kids you choose are mature enough to comfortably follow directions. They are often chosen from the children of close friends or family, or the children of the couple if they have any that age. A ring bearer can also, of course, be a girl.</p>

<p>8 Supler Cute Ring Bearers Wedding outfit for boys I was the ring bearer at their mother�s wedding, and i was in middle school at the time. Usually, flower girls and ring bearers range from ages three to eight years old. Younger children are more likely to get nervous, so picking a youngster who is a little older should be considered. There is no reason to feel obligated to stick to having one ring bearer and one flower girl for your wedding. Or, if you�re having a long train, one can act as a page boy (train bearer) instead. I was going to have them both be flower girls,and then get someone else to be the ring bearer.</p>

<p>Pin by Rachel Rouse on My Big Day Flower girl wagon Kids this age are ideal for bringing in on a rehearsal to show them where and when they will be walking. At this stage, kids are able to walk down the aisle without much cajoling or convincing. From toddlers to grandmothers, your flower girl can be anyone. She can toss petals out as she rides along. In this arrangement, the eldest child can help to keep younger children on track. Kids ages five to eight are perfect flower girls.</p>
