<p>Scientists Somehow Just Discovered a New System of Vessels Cerebrospinal fluid (csf) is a clear,. In the brain, csf is produced in special structures to perfuse through the nervous tissue of the cns and is continuous with the interstitial fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid flows between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater. Cerebrospinal fluid (csf) passes between two of the layers of the meninges and, thus, slowly circulates over the entire perimeter of the central nervous system (cns). Cerebrospinal fluid (csf) is a clear, colorless body fluid found within the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord of all vertebrates.it replaces the body fluid found outside the cells of all bilateral animals.
