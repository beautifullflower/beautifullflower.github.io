<p>Instagram photo by Black J • May 25, 2016 at 1010am UTC It was officially adopted as the national anthem in 1948, when south korea was founded. Korea is compared poetically to the flower in the south korean national anthem. National tree of the dprk Mugunghwa is also attached to south korea itself as referred by chinese as ’where mungunghwa blooms.’ The traditional flag of korea, the taegukgi, and the symbol taeguk, were swapped for communist symbols. Essentially a simple song, it consists of the refrain ‘arirang, arirang, arariyo’ and two simple lines, which differ from region to region.</p>

<p>Hibiscus syriacus (&quot;Mugunghwa&quot;, Rose of Sharon) Korea�s The national anthem of the dprk is “aegukka”, which means “patriotic song”. There is no better song to kick off korean karaoke than �반갑습니다�, which translates as �glad to meet you�. Korean traditional or folk music (called gukak in korean) has been passed down through the generations since antiquity.gukak has many distinct traits, from the most basic elements of the music to its tone and format. Upon its liberation in 1945 and subsequent foundation in 1948, north korea adopted national symbols distinct from the national symbols of south korea. The n ational emblem gukjang includes the yin yang symbol and the national flower combined. With this spirit and this mind, give all loyalty, in suffering or in joy, to the love of country.</p>
