<p><strong>How Fast Does Blood Flow Through Capillaries</strong>, Blood travels at three feet per second when it leaves the heart, but it slows down as it gets into smaller arteries and capillaries. If all of the sphincters are closed, then the blood will flow directly from the arteriole to the venule through the thoroughfare channel. This happens through two processes:</p>

<p>The blood pressure is low as the blood moves through the capillaries. The reason goes beyond the fact that capillaries are farthest from the heart. How veins work in a normal person, the heart pumps arterial blood that is full of oxygen and nutrients, out into the body, limbs and head through the arterial system. Substances which exit include water, oxygen, and glucose; This happens through two processes:</p>

As blood is pumped out of the heart, it will travel through one main artery, then several smaller arteries, into smaller arterioles, and eventually into much smaller capillaries. The blood volume is essentially spread out there. Once the blood has travelled through the arteries into the capillaries (which lie in all […] If all of the sphincters are closed, then the blood will flow directly from the arteriole to the venule through the thoroughfare channel.</p>

A typical human body contains 5.6 liters (6 quarts) of blood. Blood travels at three feet per second when it leaves the heart, but it slows down as it gets into smaller arteries and capillaries. It takes a minute to get around the body. Pulmonary capillary blood is thus almost completely replaced with each heartbeat, which means a red blood cell travels through the capillaries in about 0.75 second.</p>

Blood flow through the veins is not the direct result of ventricular contraction. At each turn the blood flow may slow down or even turn around and go backwards for a second before going forward again.
