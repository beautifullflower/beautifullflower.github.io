<p>Instead of sf, people also use supply growth rate (flow/stock). A known (visible and accountable) supply; Assets with higher stock to flow ratio are more valuable to investors as they indicate greater scarcity since less and less additional supply is added in relative to the existing amount of that asset. For 6,000 years gold has been used to store wealth. It is from these two amounts that the ratio is derived.</p>

<p>Series Convergence Flowchart Math Math &amp; More Math Generally, the stock to flow model is used in natural resources which is most commonly seen with gold and other natural resources. It is not possible to fully understand why gold is money without understanding the stock to flow ratio and its significance. Put another way, it is the years of inventory relative to annual supply. For store of value (sov) commodities like gold, platinum, or silver, a high ratio indicates that they are mostly not consumed in industrial applications. It is the ramifications of this simple ratio, when compared to the stock to flow ratio of other metals, that is so startling. Flow is the yearly production.</p>

<p>WBD154 Interview with PlanB (Banner).png How to plan This ratio is mostly relevant to assets with limited supply, such as precious metals like gold and silver and recently cryptocurrencies. \text {sf ratio} = \frac {\text {currently circulating coins}} {\text {newly supplied coins}} sf ratio =newly supplied coinscurrently circulating coins. It is defined as the ratio of the current stock of a commodity and the flow of new production, and is applied across many asset classes. Put another way, it is the years of inventory relative to annual supply. Platinum and palladium have a ratio of 1.1 and 0.4 respectively.

<p>Sample Cash Flow Statement Format Cash flow statement The stock to flow (s/f) ratio is a popular model that assumes that scarcity drives value. Messari.io and coinmetrics.io calculated for date: The stock to flow ratio is the amount of a resource that holds in reserves then divides by the amount that produces annually. Platinum and palladium have a ratio of 1.1 and 0.4 respectively. Bitcoin�s price has historically followed the s/f ratio, making it a popular model for predicting future bitcoin valuations. Generally, the stock to flow model is used in natural resources which is most commonly seen with gold and other natural resources.</p>

<p>Pin by Leonel on Projects to Try (With images) Cash flow Commodities are unique investments because they are not cash yielding. This is known as the ‘flow’. S2f = stock ÷ flow = total supply already mined ÷ new supply produced each year the higher this number, the more years it would take to produce the current supply. So let’s take gold for an example. Put another way, it is the years of inventory relative to annual supply. Stock to flow (sf) ratio is defined as a ratio of currently circulating coins divided by newly supplied coins.</p>
