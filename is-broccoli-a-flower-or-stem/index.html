<p>Pin on In the garden 2019 Sometimes broccoli will grow tall and bolt before the broccoli has a chance to form a large head. These are essential for the propagation or breeding of the crop from the main parent stock. Use them as an edible garnish or include them as a nutritious and attractive addition to any salad. Broccoli is a member of the cole crop or brassicaceae family, and as such, has a number of insects that enjoy the tasty head as much as we do. However, the florets, which are where the seeds and flowers develop, have a higher concentration of protective phytochemicals, notably beta carotene and other carotenoids as well as sulforaphane. Broccoli is a cool weather vegetable usually eaten for its delicious head.</p>
