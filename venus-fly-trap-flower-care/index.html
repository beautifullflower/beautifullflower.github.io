Pouring water over the top of the pot and allowing it to soak into the soil will carry some nitrogen down into the soil and aerate the roots. Learn more about proper care for venus flytraps and adapt your current set up. Once your flower stalk cuttings are set on their pot, it is of crucial importance to keep them healthy. Although they can still grow in pots without drainage holes, this requires you to pay more attention to how much and how often you water.

<p>Pin by Hannah Shelby on plants Venus fly trap, Fly traps The flower stalk requires a tremendous amount of energy and will take that from your venus flytrap plant, debilitating and sometimes killing the entire plant. Here is a short rundown on the process of collecting seeds: If you let them develop they can easily kill your venus flytrap and, at a minimum, a flower stalk will very seriously deter the growth of your venus flytrap. Many venus fly traps die after flowering, or become weak and don’t grow as well, after the dormant winter season. The basic idea of pollinating a flower is that the pollen from the anthers that are on the top of the filaments (stamen) must come in contact with a receptive pistil. Once its prey has taken the sweet bait, the fly trap waits patiently for it to fall into the plant’s trap.</p>

Learn about pollination and consider taking on a project to harvest venus flytrap seeds. Not all at the same time, but through the same period. They need about 12 hours of sun a day.</p>

<p>Pin on Decoration Because venus fly trap is a carnivore, care for it also differs from care for other houseplants in that you will be feeding it (preferably live) flies, mosquitoes, and gnats to nourish it (in addition to whatever it may catch on its own). Never give your plants what comes out of your tap; If you know temperatures will get close to freezing (in these zones it likely will) you will need to make sure to cover the plants with burlap or a shade cloth. It�s usually too alkaline or might have too many minerals. It is a little late to cut the flower stalk off completely now, but i�d still advise pinching off the flower buds at the very top of the stalk. There are few plants more curious and captivating than the venus fly trap;</p>
