<p>Pin on SchoppeBräu We cloned this beer in 2017. Hi all, i am looking for an all grain flower power clone. After four days, bottle or keg. Three weeks ago it was a friday night and i got off work at 4pm. Now, in part four i’ll go over how the yeast pitching went and how primary fermentation is doing. The maltose express recipe has more hops in the boil than the treehouse version so it will still taste great three or four months after brewing it!</p>
