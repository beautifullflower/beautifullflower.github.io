<p>The Victorian language of flowers Flower meanings A white violet indicated “innocence” and a purple violet would symbolize that the giver’s “thoughts were occupied with love” about the recipient. Sacrifice, immortal love, health, memorial, passion. Ardor, intense feeling of love; Daisies often symbolized innocence and purity. The victorians developed their love for flower meanings because it was an ancient tradition in the ottoman empire and other parts of the east, and england was conquering and trading with much of that region just as a lapse in major wars gave the upper class. Your florist can help you send the right message.</p>
