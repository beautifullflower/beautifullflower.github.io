<p>Die bou van �n plant Plants, Parts of a flower, Van This process is called fertilization. Within the seed, the growing embryo develops and matures. The ovary of the flower develops into the fruit while ovules develop into seeds. Flower structure flowers are organs of sexual reproduction produced by the angiosperms (phylum anthophyta), the largest phylum of photosynthetic organisms, with roughly 250,000 species. The stamen produces pollen grains that later form the male cells, or sperms. The seeds formed that fall on the ground might not always be planted by humans.</p>

The plant seed is an organ found in plant shoot, attached to the stem, and originating from a flower. The seed completes the process of reproduction initiated in the flower.
