<p>The basic function of these vessels is to take deoxygenated blood from different organs, supply it to the heart, and then take oxygenated blood that comes from the lungs into the heart to the rest of your body. The deoxygenated blood from the heart enters the lungs through the pulmonary valve as seen in the human heart diagram. These vessels connect other organs in your body to your heart.

The deoxygenated blood from the heart enters the lungs through the pulmonary valve as seen in the human heart diagram. This medical illustration depicts a diagram of blood flow through the body.

<p>Step Of Blood Flow Through The Heart Heart Blood Flow Blood then enters into the left atrium. All blood enters the right side of the heart through two veins: Our heart pumps pure blood to different parts of the body and then takes the deoxygenated blood from all the parts to the lungs for oxygenation. These vessels connect other organs in your body to your heart. This process occurs on an average of 70 to 75 times a minute, pumping about 2,000 gallons of blood every day. It transports deoxygenated blood to the lungs to absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide.</p>

The flow of blood through the heart follows a very deliberate path to ensure that oxygenated blood from the lungs passes through major arteries and gets delivered to body tissues. To get the richly, oxygenated blood that left the lungs to the body to feed the brain, tissue, muscles, organs etc.) 7. This newly oxygenated blood goes through the left side and out the aorta, the main artery going from the heart to the body. The blood then moves through the tricuspid valve (shown as two white flaps) into the right ventricle chamber of the heart. Superior and inferior vena cavae and the coronary sinus 2.</p>

<p>Pulmonary Circulation Coloring Page Heart and lungs Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the heart via the pulmonary veins #8 (only veins to have oxygen rich blood) into the left atrium #9. Observe in the heart diagram blood flow above that the human heart is connected with blood vessels that pump blood from and to our body. The circulation of the blood through the heart starts when blood comes back to the heart through two big veins called the vena cava. The pattern described below is repeated over and over, causing blood to flow continuously to the heart, lungs, and body. The backflow of blood in pulmonary trunk and aorta is prevented due to presence of semilunar valves. See blood flow heart lungs stock video clips.</p>

Beginning with the superior and inferior vena cavae and the coronary sinus, the flowchart below summarizes the flow of blood through the heart, including all arteries, veins, and valves that are passed along the way. Then the blood enters the right atrium chamber of the heart. The backflow of blood in pulmonary trunk and aorta is prevented due to presence of semilunar valves. See blood flow heart lungs stock video clips. Observe in the heart diagram blood flow above that the human heart is connected with blood vessels that pump blood from and to our body.</p>

<p>The four chambers of the heart, and the blood vessels Beginning with the superior and inferior vena cavae and the coronary sinus, the flowchart below summarizes the flow of blood through the heart, including all arteries, veins, and valves that are passed along the way. This process occurs on an average of 70 to 75 times a minute, pumping about 2,000 gallons of blood every day. Our heart pumps pure blood to different parts of the body and then takes the deoxygenated blood from all the parts to the lungs for oxygenation. Coronary arteries and the systemic circulation of blood from aorta of left ventricle carry the oxygenated blood from lungs back to heart. Www.fda.gov inferior vena cava brings blood from the legs and the lower part of the body superior vena cava brings blood from the head, neck, and arms blood from the body is carried into the heart’s right atrium by blood vessels. To get the richly, oxygenated blood that left the lungs to the body to feed the brain, tissue, muscles, organs etc.) 7.</p>

<p>Inner Body Cardiovascular system, Circulatory system Oxygenated blood then travels from the lungs and enters the left side of the heart, specifically the left atrium. &gt; from there, it is pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs. The pattern described below is repeated over and over, causing blood to flow continuously to the heart, lungs, and body. It transports deoxygenated blood to the lungs to absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. These vessels connect other organs in your body to your heart. This process is called pulmonary circulation.</p>

<p>Direction of blood flow in heart Nurse Emily Pinterest The svc collects blood from the upper half of the body. Blood then enters into the left atrium. Blood then leaves the right ventricle #5 and the heart through the pulmonic valve #6 into the pulmonary artery #7 (only artery to have oxygen poor blood) and to the lungs. In the lungs, it picks up oxygen and drops off carbon dioxide. This newly oxygenated blood goes through the left side and out the aorta, the main artery going from the heart to the body. Blood enters from the lungs through the pulmonary vein.</p>
