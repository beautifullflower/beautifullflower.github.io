<p>Pin by Cynthia Fulkerson on Purple Oxalis Pinterest They are very common in a variety of soil types especially after having been recently disturbed. Dark leaves are met with three smooth leaves and a singular pink and purple flower. If you let this weed hang around in your yard too long, the stem becomes woody. Start by pulling the purple weeds from the garden or lawn. It can be difficult to pull, so i recommend waiting until the soil is moist. More photos will be added as i collect them.</p>
