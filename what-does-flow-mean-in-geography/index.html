<p>The sum of all the water flowing over the drainage basin’s surface is called runoff. Turbulent flow, type of fluid (gas or liquid) flow in which the fluid undergoes irregular fluctuations, or mixing, in contrast to laminar flow, in which the fluid moves in smooth paths or layers. Rates of water movement via throughflow are usually low. To proceed or be produced continuously and effortlessly: (of liquids) to move or be conveyed as in a stream.</p>
<h3 id="viscous-fluid-is-called-a-flow">…viscous fluid is called a flow.</h3><p>The meanders in the jet stream flow slower than the rest of the air and are called rossby waves. Channel flow is just how and how mush water flows through a channel. Flow resources can only be natural resources.

Meander gradients are usually more gentle and they experience lateral (sideways) erosions which widen the channel of the river at the middle and lower courses of a river. What does mass movement mean in geography? Flow maps are a type of map used in cartography to show the movement of objects between different areas on the earth’s surface.

It is made up of streamflow, which is flow through permanent river channels, and overland flow or surface. In turbulent flow the speed of the fluid at a point is continuously undergoing changes in both magnitude and direction. To give a better definition you need to examine what it means.

As a result, it slows the eastward movement of the air when there is a significant amount of meandering in the flow. Geography has always been about places and the differences between them. The most basic reason is the angle of repose, or slope of the hillside. As the air rises, it cools, condenses and forms clouds.</p>

The term ‘meander’ is one which refers to a winding curve or bend in a river. Geography has always been about places and the differences between them. This is called lag time. Recently, the geographical conception of place has become more sophisticated, with the realization that all places are connected to other places and traversed by all sorts of flows, like migrants, money, goods, germs, satellite images, and digital.

Erosion is the breaking down of material by an agent. In hydrology, throughflow, a subcomponent of interflow, is the lateral unsaturated flow of water in the soil zone, where a highly permeable geologic unit overlays a less permeable geologic unit, and which returns to the surface, as return flow, prior to entering a stream or groundwater. This water then flows underground until it reaches a river, lake, or ocean. To proceed or be produced continuously and effortlessly: To move or progress freely as if in a stream:</p>
