<p>Pin on Animal crossing For those who have not explored this yet or are new to the game, you do this by strategically planting different colour flowers which then spawn rare and hybrid colours. Once two flowers are paired, they will not pair with other nearby flowers! The hybrid flowers will grow in the space that is left in between them. Flowers are a great way to add some color to your island in animal crossing: Allow your flowers to grow, making sure to water to them every day, and eventually hybrid flowers will seed in the empty spaces you�ve left. When they breed, there�s a 25% chance the offspring will be black.</p>
