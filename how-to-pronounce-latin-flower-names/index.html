<p>Pin by Chandshahin on Names Flower letters, Alphabet They aren�t easy to pronounce or remember but because they are the names used by people in so many different countries, they are worth getting to know. Eddie murphy gave this name to his fourth daughter, zola ivy murphy and guitarist dweezil zappa also named his daughter zola frank zappa, thus making the name quite popular. I couldn’t make this list without mentioning flora. First, no one knows how latin was really pronounced. Can you pronounce this word better. Bouquet, crown, blossom, bloom, juice of flowers.</p>

<p>Fiorella, My Name in Chinese Drawing Chinese Tools Scientific latin plant names are used as a means of classifying or identifying specific plants. The official state flower of hawaii is not the orchid or plumeria, as most of us would assume, but the yellow hibiscus, also known as the pua aloalo. Quite honestly anyone who says that they found the latin names easy to learn when they started to look for wild flowers is a bit of a fibber. This makes things difficult, indeed. The book has an alphabetical list of over 3,000 latin names which also tells you how to pronounce each word. Leilani is derived from the hawaiian elements lei, meaning “flower,” and lani, “heavenly.”.</p>
