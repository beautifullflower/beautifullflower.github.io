<p>The volumetric flow rate of the water is proportional to the rotational speed of the blades. 1 to 15 gpm 8 to 120 gpm: Mechanical flow meters these are known to be the most commonly used flow meters as they measure the flow through turbine rotation with a propeller shunt or paddle wheel design. The most common mechanical flow meters are inserted into a pipe and use a turbine, wheel or paddle to measure velocity and then calculate volumetric flow by knowing the cross section area of the pipe in which they are installed. Flow meters are devices used to measure the flow rate or quantity of a gas or liquid in a pipe.</p>
<h3 id="the-most-common-type-of-mechanical-flow-meter-is-the-classic-rotameter">The most common type of mechanical flow meter is the classic rotameter.</h3><p>As water flows through the metering chamber, it causes a disc to wobble (nutate), turning a spindle, which rotates a magnet. They are for water containing particles 100 microns (similar to flour) or larger. While they both measure the flow of a liquid in a pipe, they do so in different ways. Available from Â¼â up to 6â bore to handle flow rates from a few litres per hour up to 600 m3/hr. The volumetric flow rate of the water is proportional to the rotational speed of the blades.</p>
