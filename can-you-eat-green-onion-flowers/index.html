<p>Green onions have one of my favorite garden plants They have a lovely mild onion flavor and you can use them just as you would use a scallion. (i use green garlic stems the same way.) Onions that have bolted don’t store well. You can pull entire plants and eat them like green onions, or you can snip off leaves as needed throughout the growing season, more like chives. Both the long, slender green tops and the small white bulb are edible, and are good either raw or cooked. One tablespoon of chopped chives can contain 0.9 calories, vitamin k, vitamin c, vitamin a, 2.76mg calcium, 8.88mg potassium.</p>

<p>How To Regrow Green Onions Regrow green onions, Inside They have a mild onion taste and are mostly eaten raw because with cooked the taste can be lost. We do the same with our onions too and find that it makes our crops go much further. Apparently they thought they were tasty. Chances are there was a garden in that spot at one time or one of your neighbors let theirs go to seed (the bees adore the flowers), and the wind blew or a wild animal deposited in your yard. Green onion flowers can be eaten raw in salads. The flowers (as well as the stems) have a mild onion flavor similar to scallions or leeks.</p>
