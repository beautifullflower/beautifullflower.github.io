<p><strong>Stalk Of A Flower In An Inflorescence</strong>, A long, simple or branched peduncle is called a rachis (fig. The entire structure is borne on a receptacle, which is supported by the flower stalk (peduncle). Any flower in an inflorescence may be referred to as a floret, especially when the individual flowers are particularly small and borne in a tight cluster, such as in a pseudanthium.</p>

<p>Pin on Plumeria Varieties and their Care and Propagation So, the correct option is �peduncle�. A raceme is an inflorescence in which a flower develops at the axil of each leaf along an elongated, unbranched axis (see photograph). Inflorescences may be divided into different ways on the basis of their general characteristics. The receptacle is typically at the very tip of the floral axis (derived from the original apical meristem). In many cases, the main axis branches out and bears flower at the branch apex, the main axis is called peduncle and the stalk of individual flower is called pedicel. For example, the arrangement of the flowers on the peduncle, how different clusters of flowers are organized in it and the blooming order of the flowers, etc.</p>
