<p>Sedum Kamtschaticum (Stonecrop) Ground cover plants The new flora of the british isles (stace, 2019) indicates the rarity of species, using r, rr and rrr. Plant up to 2.5 feet tall, flower 5 cm across including spines The flowers look too pretty to be a weed, and i�m hoping any of you could let me know the name of this plant. The bulb belongs to the winter lily family. We compiled a list of sunny shades and included basic growing information like sun and soil needs. The compact flowers with their bright fall colors look delightful in any garden in september and october.</p>
