<p>Gentle Yoga Flow for Stress Relief and Deep Relaxation Urine may be cloudy in appearance; Sometimes the urine stream splits into two. Urine may be cloudy in appearance; When the gland swells, it presses down on the urethra, which constricts the flow of urine, causing slower urine flow and difficulty starting urination. Bladder outlet obstruction can cause urine to back up in your system, leading to difficulty urinating and other uncomfortable urinary symptoms. Most of the time only a trickle, but it takes forever and if someone is next to me in the urinal i can forget about expelling my urine.</p>

<p>Prostacor (30 Day Supply) Another possible reason which slows down the stream of urine is uti (urinary tract infection). 39 years experience clinical psychology. I am a 29 year old male, with very frequent urination occasionally. Most of the time, people will be unaware of the problem until it gets severe.

<p>Weak urine stream Urinal, Streaming, Enlarged prostate Slow urinary stream in men is most often caused by obstruction of urinary flow from an enlarged prostate. Often, men need to wait for urine flow to start. A weak urine stream majorly means difficulty in getting a urine flow. You usually also have pain in your groin or pelvis, and possibly chills or a fever. Inflammation of the prostate from infection can also cause a slowing of the urinary stream in men. Voiding dysfunction is defined by the international continence society and international urogynecological association as “abnormal, slow, and/or incomplete micturition” as diagnosed by symptoms and urodynamic investigations.</p>

<p>Pin on yogaeveryday This type of incontinence often occurs as part of a group of symptoms called overactive bladder syndrome, which is when the bladder muscle is more active than usual. These symptoms may include slowing of the urine stream and needing to get up to pass urine at night. Voiding dysfunction is defined by the international continence society and international urogynecological association as “abnormal, slow, and/or incomplete micturition” as diagnosed by symptoms and urodynamic investigations. One common cause of urinary hesitancy in men is a benign, enlarged prostate. There may be some bug in the urethra (lower uti) or the bladder. A weak urine stream majorly means difficulty in getting a urine flow.</p>
