<p>Because these flows are mostly gas, their flow is. Gas temperatures can reach 600 to 700 °c (1,100 to 1,300 °f), and the flow’s velocity can exceed 100 km (60 miles) per hour. Collapse of the ash column from a plinian eruption (e.g mount vesuvius, see pliny the younger). Pyroclastic flows are clouds of hot volcanic gases, ash and volcanic bombs that can sweep down the volcano�s sides and other steep hills at speeds over 100 miles per hour. Pyroclastic sediment gravity flows can move rapidly for long distances, their deposits generally being much thicker in valleys than on ridges.</p>

This water picks up the newly erupted material forming fast flowing torrents of water, mud, ash, rock and debris. There are several scenarios which can produce a pyroclastic flow: A pyroclastic flow is extremely hot, burning anything in its path. In such an eruption, the material ejected from the vent heats the surrounding air and the turbulent mixture rises for many kilometres through convection. There aren�t really records for the size of a pyroclastic flow, but as a general rule the eruptions that eject the greatest amount of tephra will probably produce the biggest pyroclastic flows.</p>

(geological science) a rapidly moving turbulent incandescent cloud of gas, ash, and rock fragments flowing close to the ground after violent ejection from a volcano. Pyroclastic flows are avalanches containing hot volcanic gases, ash and volcanic bombs. There are several scenarios which can produce a pyroclastic flow: Collapse of the ash column from a plinian eruption (e.g mount vesuvius, see pliny the younger).

This water picks up the newly erupted material forming fast flowing torrents of water, mud, ash, rock and debris. Heavy rain after an eruption or hot volcanic activity melting snow and ice will provide a large volume of water that will flow down the sides of the volcano.

They are the most deadly event to happen at a volcano. There are several scenarios which can produce a pyroclastic flow: It occurs as part of certain volcanic eruptions. During an explosive volcanic eruption, gravity can cause the eruption column to collapse creating a pyroclastic density current. A famous historic example of an explosive eruption that produced devastating pyroclastic flows was the 79ad eruption of mt vesuvius in italy that buried the ancient roman city of pompei.</p>
