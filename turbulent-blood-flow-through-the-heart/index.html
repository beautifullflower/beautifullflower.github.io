<p>Or it may indicate some problem within the heart. Thus, no sound is normally heard via a stethoscope placed over arteries. Your doctor hears this sound with a stethoscope. Turbulent flow also occurs in large arteries at branch points, in diseased and narrowed (stenotic or partially obstructed) arteries (see figure below), and across stenotic heart valves. These sounds are known as korotkoff sounds.</p>

Below are several conditions and factors that can temporarily increase blood flow through the heart, causing a flow murmur: The technique of measuring blood pressure requires the use of a sphygmomanometer (a blood pressure cuff attached to a measuring device) and a stethoscope. The nurse is educating a group of teens about the prevention of cardiovascular disease. A doctor can evaluate heart sounds by listening with a stethoscope. Below are several conditions and factors that can temporarily increase blood flow through the heart, causing a flow murmur: Turbulent blood flow is particularly common in patients with carotid artery disease and in individuals who have problems with the aorta.</p>

<p>Pin on SHOCKHEAD INJURIES The heart has four chambers — two upper chambers (called atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Not having enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body tissues (anemia) Oxygenated flows returning to the heart from the lungs are shown in red. They can be further evaluated with an echocardiogram to see what the exact cause of the murmur is. And the sound is called a benign flow murmur. Under most conditions, the blood flows through the body’s arteries and veins in a laminar fashion.</p>

The technique of measuring blood pressure requires the use of a sphygmomanometer (a blood pressure cuff attached to a measuring device) and a stethoscope. Despite the pulsatile nature of flow in arteries, laminar blood flow is silent.

<p>Heart Murmurs in Dogs Heart murmur, Cushing disease The sound is caused by turbulent (rough) blood flow through the heart valves or near the heart. Outside of the heart, audible turbulence is referred to as a bruit, whereas inside the heart it is called a murmur. A heart murmur is a blowing, whooshing, or rasping sound heard during a heartbeat. Turbulent flow also occurs in large arteries at branch points, in diseased and narrowed (stenotic or partially obstructed) arteries (see figure below), and across stenotic heart valves. Constriction of the vessel, or obstruction of the vessel lumen, disrupts laminar flow and leads to turbulent blood flow. Test taking tips:key word is turbulent, which differentiates it from other sounds.</p>
