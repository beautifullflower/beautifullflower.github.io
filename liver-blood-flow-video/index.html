<p>There are two sources that supply all this blood to the liver: There is a considerable discrepancy between oxygen supply and demand in the liver because hepatic oxygen consumption is relatively high but about 70% of the hepatic blood supply is poorly oxygenated portal vein blood derived from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen. However, it provides 30% to 50% of the liver’s oxygen requirement because of the greater oxygen content found in arterial blood. The liver is unique among organs in that it receives blood via two distinct circulatory routes: Blood that leaves through the hepatic vein from the liver will circulate back to the heart to receive oxygen, flow past the intestines to receive nutrients, and then return to the liver, either through the portal vein or through the proper hepatic artery.</p>

In liver cirrhosis, deposition of collagen in the space of disse and subsequent increased resistance to incoming sinusoidal blood flow are known to be responsible for the decreased portal flow, which is counteracted by an increase in hepatic arterial flow through the hepatic arterial buffer response. Due to its high blood flow (25% of cardiac output) and immense blood filtration capacity, the liver produces up to 50% of all lymph volume flowing in the thoracic duct.

Oxygen is delivered to hepatocy … Although the free pressure in a hepatic vein is 1 to 2 mm hg, the wedged hepatic venous pressure, which is useful for estimating sinusoidal pressure, may be an indicator of portal venous pressure ( boyer et al, 1977 ). Blood coming from our digestive system enters the liver through the hepatic portal vein carrying nutrients, medications, or toxins. Portal hypertension can also lead to the growth of new blood vessels, called collaterals, that connect blood flow from the intestine to the circulatory system, ultimately bypassing the liver.

In liver cirrhosis, deposition of collagen in the space of disse and subsequent increased resistance to incoming sinusoidal blood flow are known to be responsible for the decreased portal flow, which is counteracted by an increase in hepatic arterial flow through the hepatic arterial buffer response. The liver has two blood supplies — one directly from an artery (similar to other tissues), and a second blood flow from the portal vein. This fact forms the basis for using spectral doppler us in diagnostic radiology.

If the problem is blood flow out of the liver, blood backs up in the liver, causing congestion which can result in an enlarged liver. Blood flows out of the top of the liver through three large veins called the hepatic veins, into a big vein called the inferior vena cava or ivc that goes to the heart. When is a vascular ultrasound of the liver is needed? This fact forms the basis for using spectral doppler us in diagnostic radiology.</p>

The hepatic artery and the hepatic portal vein. Due to its high blood flow (25% of cardiac output) and immense blood filtration capacity, the liver produces up to 50% of all lymph volume flowing in the thoracic duct.</p>
