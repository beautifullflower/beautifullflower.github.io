<p>Pin by Candace Arnold on Holidays (With images) Birth Comes with a small letterpressed floral card. The february birth month flowers a re the violet and the primrose. It was discovered that poor jimin of bts, aka the bangtan boys, who celebrates his birthday on october 13, has a birth flower called “spirea,” and it means “neat love.” A real symbol of the season, it’s no surprise that the holly is the birth flower for december. Leaf plants should be harvested in these flower days. Though technically a foliage and not a flower, the glossy green leaves and bright red berries of the holly are synonymous with christmas spirit and so an apt choice for celebrating a december birthday.</p>
