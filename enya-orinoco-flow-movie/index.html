Play pieces like may it be, orinoco flow, a day without rain.enya�s music is mainly in the genres new age, celtic, christmas. Enya peforming only time, orinoco flow, and may it be live. Music monday is a meme, created by drew at the tattooed book geek, where i focus on a song i absolutely love and feel needs to be shared. Usually if you hear enya’s song orinoco flow (sail away), it’s mean to be inspiring and give you grandiose visions of something, anything, that could be. Posted by 9 years ago.</p>
