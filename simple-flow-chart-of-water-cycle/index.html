<p><strong>Simple Flow Chart Of Water Cycle</strong>, The flowchart can be used to depict a simple project life cycle—such as the initiation, definition, design, development, and implementation phases—for better process management. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and subsurface flow. Higher, it becomes cooler and begins to move.</p>

The steps involved in the process map are usually arranged in a sequential order, specifically from start to finish. The flowchart can be used to depict a simple project life cycle—such as the initiation, definition, design, development, and implementation phases—for better process management. Water is always changing states between liquid, vapor, and ice, with these processes happening in the blink of an eye and over millions of years. Also known as hydrologic cycle, the water cycle is a phenomenon where water moves through the three phases (gas, liquid and solid) over the four spheres (atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere) and completes a full cycle.
