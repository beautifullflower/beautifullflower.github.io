<p>Guarianthe skinneri (Bat.) Dreslr. &amp; W.E.Higg. �Dayana Recently a second species of bat flower has been introduced which has white bracts with purple veining and purple bracteoles. This plant does not like to be root bound. Indoor plants should be misted regularly with an atomiser to maintain humidity. Bat plants love humid environments and thrive in these conditions. The newly repotted plants have taken off and produed phenomenal root growth in a matter of days (not weeks) with new, thick roots at soil level growng several centimeters a day. Taccas have large, beautiful foliage and prefer to be grown in low light with good air circulation.</p>

If the temperature goes below 55f, bat flowers may die. Watering should be done regularly, just enough to keep the plant moist, but not too soggy. When kept indoors with proper care you can expect your white bat plant to reach 2 to 3 feet in length. They grow 2 to 3 feet tall. During the winter, when your white bat plant is resting, allow the soil to dry slightly before watering.</p>
