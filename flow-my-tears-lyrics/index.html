<p>&quot;And Tomorrow&quot;, a poem my Tupac Amaru Shakur. Tupac Flow my teares fall from your springs, exilde for ever: Flow my teares fall from your springs, exilde for ever: 1 in d minor, the annunciation Never may my woes be relieved, Flow, my tears, fall from your springs! Downe vaine lights shine you no more, no nights are dark enough for those</p>

<p>&hellip;allow the tears to flow&hellip; Christian quotes, Words, Faith Not the labor of my hands can fulfill thy law’s demands; / exiled for ever, let me mourn. Flow, my tears, fall from your springs! Where night�s black bird her sad infamy sings, there let me live forlorn. Down vain lights, shine you no more! Nothing in my hand i bring, simply to thy cross i cling;</p>
