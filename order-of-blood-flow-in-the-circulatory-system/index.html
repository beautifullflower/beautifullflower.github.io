The order of blood vessels is great vessels, arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, veins and back to the cavae. In this educational lesson, we learn about the blood flow order through the human heart in 14 easy steps, from the superior and inferior vena cava to the atria and ventricles. These arteries, veins, and capillaries make for a vast network of pipes. Come also learn with us the heart’s anatomy, including where deoxygenated and oxygenated blood flow, in the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, atrium, ventricle, aorta, pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, and coronary arteries.

The circulatory system of the human body consists of pipes that are connected in series and in parallel. That blood then goes out the left ventricle to the body and returns via the vena cavae. Eventually, comes back to heart by vein. Blood flows through the heart in the following order:</p>

Blood is circulated throughout your body via your arterial system—arteries, arterioles, and capillaries— and returned to your heart via the venous system—veins and venules. The heart (cardiovascular), lungs (pulmonary), and arteries, veins, coronary and portal vessels (systemic). The blood then goes out into the lungs and returns via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium. Check all statements that are correct about the nervous system control of blood flow.</p>

Blood flowing through the circulatory system transports nutrients, oxygen, and water to cells throughout the body. They exchange the material in blood vessels called capillaries.
