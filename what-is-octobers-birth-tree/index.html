<p>“It must be October, the trees are full of colors The berries of the rowan tree feeds birds during long winters and have a pentagram shape. Tourmaline has a distinguished spot among sacred stones thanks to it having vast color variations. When it comes to rebirth, it denotes the death of everything bad such as greed, arrogance, selfishness and rudeness and hints on replacing it with a new arrival of happiness, prosperity, love and admiration, growth and success. Echoing colors that summer has never seen with its warm yet fierce coloration, the marigold perfectly sums up the fiery hues that are often. October�s birthstones are the tourmaline and opal. The calendula, pretty and practical, is the birth month flower of october.</p>
