<p>Choosing the correct size for your filter will allow the filter to do its job properly. What happens if a furnace filter faces the wrong direction? Over time, dust and other debris can collect in the filter, reducing the efficiency of the furnace. This pulls the air across your body. The return air vent openings need to be on the opposite side of the room so the conditioned air is pulled across the room.</p>

<p>Pin by GDRives on Woodworking Woodworking, Air filter Though, this is the case with any furnace filter that removes pollutants and dust from the atmosphere within your property as it’s continuously going to be filtering the air. Many people experience trouble in the job, as they end up inserting the furnace filter backwards or in an improper position. Furnace and air conditioner filters are important devices for helping to remove dust and pollutants from the air in your home, and are often designed to have air flow through them in a particular direction. Remember that the air needs to be filtered before it enters the air handler and furnace. The arrow refers to air flow. Clogs may cause the furnace to shut down.</p>

A filter that is either too small or two large, will create gaps around the filter, in turn allowing air to flow around the sides. If the supply ducts are in the floor, then the return air should be located up high. Choosing the correct size for your filter will allow the filter to do its job properly.

<p>F16 Rained out, great pic Usaf “a dirty filter will slow down air flow and make the system work harder to keep you warm or cool—wasting energy. This will make it more difficult for your air handler to keep air flowing through the filter, which will force your furnace to work harder and consume more energy to make up for the loss of airflow. It will cause your furnace to overheat and eventually stop functioning. On your new air filter, find the arrow that indicates the proper air flow direction. Why furnace filter size is important. A horizontal furnace lies on its side, pulling cool air from one side and pushing warm air out of the other.</p>

<p>How to Double the Life of Your Furnace Furnace air flow Over time, dust and other debris can collect in the filter, reducing the efficiency of the furnace. In the most severe cases, a dirty furnace air filter may cause damage to the internal components of the furnace. At the end of the day, the short answer is: Below is my furnace and i need to change the filter however i am unsure which way is the airflow direction. If an air filter is installed in the wrong direction, air will have to pass through the filter via the less porous side. Furnace and air conditioner filters are important devices for helping to remove dust and pollutants from the air in your home, and are often designed to have air flow through them in a particular direction.</p>
