<p><strong>High Flow Air Filter Vs Stock</strong>, Oiled filters flow more air through their media because they are constructed from a more open cotton material that is coated with a thin layer of oil. These high flow panel filters are a direct replacement of your factory air filter, but they allow your turbo to breathe a little easier for improved performance.

But the airflow into the engine is only part of the story with an induction kit. In fact, a high flow air filter can actually increase your horsepower by about 3 to 5 hp and increase your torque as well. Your truck (most stock maps) are programmed to be very fat (rich) in mixture so by installing a aftermarket high flow air filter you will allow more air to flow into the throttle body. Green air filters feature modern, advanced designs and materials to provide not only unmatched flow, but also easy maintenance and a super long lifespan.</p>

The restriction to flow curves graphically show how each “clean” filter responded to a steadily increasing flow of air up to 350 cfm. Your truck (most stock maps) are programmed to be very fat (rich) in mixture so by installing a aftermarket high flow air filter you will allow more air to flow into the throttle body. Our best dyno numbers for the k&amp;n typhoon on the l99 ss were 336.9 horsepower, and 355.1 pound feet of torque. Cold air intake systems / high flow air filters:</p>

<p>High Flow Performance Air Filter Motorcycle Air Intake However, note how the ac filter, which passed the smallest amount of dirt and had the highest dirt capacity and efficiency, also had the highest relative restriction to flow. The less efficient filters correspondingly had less restriction to flow. The restriction to flow curves graphically show how each “clean” filter responded to a steadily increasing flow of air up to 350 cfm. The flow restriction response curves for each filter have the same basic shape. A performance air intake replaces your stock intake tube with a wider pipe that has fewer bends. You�ll get a small power gain as well, but not enough to make any noticeable difference.</p>

<p>K&amp;N 8707 Honda VT1100C/VT1100CL/VT1100C2/VT1100C3/VT1100T These high flow panel filters are a direct replacement of your factory air filter, but they allow your turbo to breathe a little easier for improved performance. And if your engine is getting more air, then it can perform better. The flow restriction response curves for each filter have the same basic shape. In fact, a high flow air filter can actually increase your horsepower by about 3 to 5 hp and increase your torque as well. A high flow air filter coupled with a redesigned filter housing allows for an enormous improvement in airflow, compared to the stock element that is virtually enclosed behind the small openings in the oem housing. We carry replacement panel filters from several brands such as cobb tuning, hks, aem, k&amp;n, afe, and perrin among many other great brands.</p>

<p>K&amp;N YA1906 Replacement Air Filter for 200614 Yamaha Oiled filters flow more air through their media because they are constructed from a more open cotton material that is coated with a thin layer of oil. The air filter has to tread that fine line where it can still allow plenty of air in while also blocking most of the particles that can harm the engine. The effectiveness of an air filter is usually measured in microns. This is because they don�t get clogged as quickly or as easily, yet they offer better air flow and better filtration of the air going into your engine. And if you decide later on that you want to. From a performance perspective, this isn�t great.</p>

Also, cold air intakes, like the aem cold air intake, relocate the air box outside of the engine combustion, which allows cooler air to be sucked in by the air filter. A performance air intake replaces your stock intake tube with a wider pipe that has fewer bends. On this episode of engine masters presented by amsoil, we test a whopping 19 different combinations of filter sizes and styles, including paper elements, k&amp;n filters, stock housings, dual snorkel housings, velocity stacks. Oiled filters flow more air through their media because they are constructed from a more open cotton material that is coated with a thin layer of oil. The filters, while having better flow than the factory paper filters, are a thinner design which effectively increases the volume of the lower airbox, further improving response and flow of the m177 intakes which in turn helps the vehicle reach greater levels of performance.</p>
