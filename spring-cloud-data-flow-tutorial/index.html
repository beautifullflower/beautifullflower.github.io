<p>IMG_20150404_113752 (4) Cloud computing, Data center In order to use spring cloud data flow, you will need to choose what platform you want to run it on and install the server components on that platform. In previous tutorial we implemented spring cloud config using native mode. From here, we can design more sophisticated and complex pipelines. In this tutorial will be using spring cloud config and hashicorp vault to manage secrets and protect sensitive data. To access the wizard, go to file | new | project, and select spring initializr. Hashicorp vault is a platform to secure, store, and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, encryption keys for protecting sensitive data and other secrets in a dynamic infrastructure.</p>
