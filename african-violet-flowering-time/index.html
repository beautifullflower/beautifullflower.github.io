<p>Starting a Flower Garden Violet plant, African violets The trick is knowing when to repot an african violet and what soil and container size to use. Many successful growers of african violets recommend repotting with fresh potting soil, twice a year or more.

<p>African Violets (With images) African violets, African African violets only bloom when they’re root bound. Then these african violets are available any time of the year in the nearest. Like most plants, african violets produce bloom from the new growth, generally the first (youngest) three rows of leaves. In fact, some african violet hybrids require fluctuations of as much as 10 degrees in order to produce optimal flowering.

At the very least, an african violet should be repotted whenever the plant becomes rootbound, i.e., the violet has outgrown its current pot to the extent that its roots are growing out and around the rootball.</p>

<p>african violet Sunset Kiss pair of leaves AfricanViolet If you are trying to achieve flowers it will need bright light. African violets will stop flowering and its leaves begin to turn yellow if they do not receive enough sunlight. This is probably one of the reasons for their popularity. The plant will take a shadier spot but at the expense of a longer period between flowering cycles. If your african violet won’t flower, too little light is the most likely cause. A little surgery, artfully performed, will restore the plant back to.</p>
