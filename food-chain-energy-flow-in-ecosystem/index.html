In scientific terms, a food chain is a chronological pathway or an order that shows the flow of energy from one organism to the other. The energy enters the plants (from the sun) through photosynthesis during the making of food. This energy is then passed on from one organism to another in a food chain. A sequence of organisms which feed on one another and transfer energy from a food chain. The below mentioned article provides an overview on the food chain, energy flow and ecological balance.</p>

Each food chain depicts a vital pathway for energy and the nutrients to follow through the ecosystem. For most ecosystem the energy source is the sun and the autotrophs are the green plants and bgas. In every biome it starts with the sun. Also some amount of energy that enters the food chain is lost to the environment in the form of heat. This chemical energy is locked up inside chemical organic compounds like fats, carbohydrates, proteins, etc.</p>

Energy given out by the organisms as heat is lost to t used by the plants again. Only green plants are able to trap solar energy and convert it into chemical energy. Also some amount of energy that enters the food chain is lost to the environment in the form of heat. In some ecosystems more energy flows through the detritus food chain than through grazing food chain. The food chain that binds to the saprophytic layer based on energy flow, is called the saprophytic food chain.</p>

The food chain is a linear series of organisms consuming one another so that the energy and nutrients pass from one to the next. The energy flow takes place via the food chain and food web. During the process of energy flow in the ecosystem, plants being the producers absorb sunlight with the help of the chloroplasts and a part of it is transformed into chemical energy in the process of photosynthesis. In a food chain, energy (organic form) is transferred from one organism to another. As against this, in a terrestrial ecosystem, a much larger fraction of energy flows through the detritus food chain than through the grazing food chain.</p>

<p>Food chains &amp; food webs (article) Ecology Khan Academy Most ecosystems contain organisms that are producers (autotrophs), such as plants, that harness energy from the sun, or consumers (heterotrophs) that feed on producers or other consumers. Definition the process by which solar energy flows in the form of potential energy at different trophic levels in the food chain is called energy flow. Energy flow in ecosystem from energy source to autotrophs to heterotrophs. This energy is transferred from produces to other organisms. In order to more efficiently show the quantity of organisms at each trophic level, these food chains are then organized into trophic pyramids. A key idea to develop is that energy progresses through the food web (or food chain) from its source, the sun, undergoing repeated transformations.</p>

There are mainly 2 types of the food chain: The energy flow takes place via the food chain and food web. Small grass and flowers, shrubs, and cacti, are fed on by herbivores such as the desert squirrel.</p>

<p>THE FOOD CHAIN ThingLink Food chain, Food chain There are mainly 2 types of the food chain: In scientific terms, a food chain is a chronological pathway or an order that shows the flow of energy from one organism to the other. The food chains are of two types, namely. In an aquatic ecosystem, the grazing food chain is the major conduit for energy flow. This energy is then passed on from one organism to another in a food chain. Also some amount of energy that enters the food chain is lost to the environment in the form of heat.</p>

<p>Assaad Razzouk on Ocean food web, Ocean food, Ocean In order to more efficiently show the quantity of organisms at each trophic level, these food chains are then organized into trophic pyramids. Communities of organisms have to feed on each other creating a system whereby each organism is eaten and, in turn, it is eaten by another organism. Energy flow in ecosystem from energy source to autotrophs to heterotrophs. A food chain starts with producers to the end with top carnivores. Students should be encouraged to observe and discuss examples of food chains where energy is transformed and matter. In detritus food chain the energy flow remains as a continuous passage rather than as a stepwise flow between discrete entities.</p>

<p>MangroveFoodWeb.jpg (1000×564) Food Webs Pinterest Most ecosystems contain organisms that are producers (autotrophs), such as plants, that harness energy from the sun, or consumers (heterotrophs) that feed on producers or other consumers. Food chain is the feeding relationship that transfers energy from one trophic level to another in an ecosystem. Only green plants are able to trap solar energy and convert it into chemical energy. The transfer of energy from one trophic level to another is called energy flow. A sequence of organisms which feed on one another and transfer energy from a food chain. In a food chain, energy (organic form) is transferred from one organism to another.</p>

<p>forest ecosystem food chain Google Search water Food chain is the feeding relationship that transfers energy from one trophic level to another in an ecosystem. Food chain in terrestrial ecosystem The transfer of energy from one trophic level to another is called energy flow. A food chain may be defined as the transfer of energy and nutrients through a succession of organisms through repeated process of eating and being eaten. In the desert, the energy from the sun goes to the plants for photosynthesis. In some ecosystems more energy flows through the detritus food chain than through grazing food chain.</p>
