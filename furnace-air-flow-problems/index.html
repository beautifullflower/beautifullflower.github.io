<p>After ruling out all of the ‘simple’ problems above, the most likely cause of a furnace not blowing air is a problem with the blower fan itself which, if you remember, is the fan that circulates your house’s air over the heated coils.

If you have air conditioning, located above your furnace cabinet is an evaporative coil which is made up of tiny fins that absorb heat and cool the air. It can also become a fire hazard and cause premature breakdowns due to excessive dust and dirt. Apparently a different wf approved installer had to use an extra large pump to remove any air pockets.</p>
