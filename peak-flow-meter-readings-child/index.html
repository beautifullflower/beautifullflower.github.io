A peak flow meter is a device prescribed by your doctor to help you monitor your child’s asthma. When you first get a peak flow meter, ask your gp, asthma nurse, or pharmacist to show you how to use it and how to take a reading. A marker will slide up a scale on the meter as your child blows out to indicate how much air was exhaled. The device measures air flowing out of the lungs, called peak expiratory flow rate (pefr), as a child forcefully blows into the device. For patients with stable asthma whose symptoms correlate well with peak flow, a peak flow monitor is adequate.</p>
