<p>Loropetalum chinensis Plum Dark Leaf Chinese Use thinning cuts to maintain a strong form. Today (11/29/19), i noticed that my chinese fringe flower ( lorapetalum chinensis) was in need of a haircut. (don’t be afraid pruning will hurt the plant because it won’t.) after this severe pruning in the spring, only remove the occasional errant shoot that outgrows the rest of the shrub. This plant can be added to your landscape at any time during the year. Because i inherited it, i’m unsure which cultivar it is; Prune in early spring to improve form and structure but, this plant blooms on old wood so you will be removing flowers.</p>

The flowers of this adaptable shrub bloom on old wood, so when pruning chinese fringe flowers it is best to wait until after the blooming period in the summer to early fall.
