<p>Deep Purple Ranunculus Garden. This is my Favorit Shade Of First used in the 18th century, lilac has incredibly deep roots. A nosegay with lilac might be an innocent gift from a youthful suitor or an attempt to rekindle an old flame. It is native to the northern balkan peninsula. These purple and white flowers put on a show all season long. The flower is influenced and protected by the planet venus. In the language of flowers, purple lilacs symbolize the first emotions of love, while white lilacs represent youthful innocence.</p>

<p>Pin by Gail Steven on Violet and mauve Purple flowers What does the lilac flower mean? Purple lilacs often symbolize first love, while in some contexts purple lilacs can suggest protection. What does the lilac flower symbolize? Put the two meanings together and the lily is the perfect symbol of grace, royal bearing, and dignity. Purple was also a color restricted only to the royal families for many centuries due to the rarity of the dye. Flowering varies between mid spring to early summer, depending on the species.</p>

<p>The Surprising Meanings Behind Your Favorite Flowers in Apparently, the color of lilac also shares the same meaning. Lilac (syringa) is a genus of flowering woody plants that belong to the oleaceae (olive) family that consists of 12 species. Seeing a purple or lilac bird is a symbol meaning you will find a new friend who will be a very joyful person. The flower is commonly associated with easter holidays. Although the species stands for renewal and confidence overall, each color of lilac has its own specific meaning. To dream of yellow and purple flowers in one vase, for example, lilac and yellow tulips, is a sign of unreasonable fun.</p>
