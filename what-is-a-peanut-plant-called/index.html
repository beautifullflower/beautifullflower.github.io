<p>Pin on Daily Life in Senegal From its botanical name, you can already tell that peanuts grow underneath the soil in their own. Indeed, it was an ambitious project: Other names include goobers, pinders, arachides (french/italian), and maní (spanish). It is sometimes called chamaecereus cactus. These downward stems are called pegs. your peanuts will grow off of these pegs, and the stems need to find their way underground in order to grow those peanuts. After fertilization, the peg (stalk) of the peanut curves downward and the developing fruit (legume) is forced into the ground.</p>
