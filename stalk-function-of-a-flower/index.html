<p>This refers to the stem or stalk of a flower. They serve to protect the flower before it blossoms. What is the function of flower stalk? Male gamete is produced by anther, where as female gamet is produced by pistil. When cutting the flower stalk into smaller pieces, cut at an angle rather than making a.</p>

The male reproductive part of a flower is called the stamen. It is a long, slender stalk that connects the stigma and the ovary. Serves as the landing place for pollen grains during pollination. A common example of the fertilization product is the strawberry.</p>

Serves as the landing place for pollen grains during pollination. The receptacle is an area where a flower binds itself to the stalk. The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.</p>

The stigma receives pollen, which will begin the process of fertilization. The jewelry color, the flower aroma, and honey gland serve to attract pollination agent. The ovary is located at the bottom of the style and houses the plant�s ovules, which contain the egg cells and supporting cells necessary for reproduction.
