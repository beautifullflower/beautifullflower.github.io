<p>January Birth Flower Images JanuaryBirthFlower Carnation For example, a pink carnation can mean simple affection, while a dark red carnation means deeper love. The snowdrop shares its symbolism with the carnation, as they are both the birth flower for the month of january. For me, snowdrops always bring a positive, hopeful feel to the winter garden, providing the first whisper of the spring that is just around the corner.no surprise then that their meaning is one of hope, rebirth and a positive future. Its innocent appearance has earned itself a reputation as a flower of sympathy or condolences. The snowdrop is the birth flower of january so if you know someone celebrating this month and you need to find a gift, simply wrap a little pot of snowdrops in tissue paper and you have a pretty and thoughtful present that will last year after year. The carnation comes in several different colours to convey different meanings, much like roses.</p>
