<p>XtremepowerUS Automatic Chlorine Bromine Chemical Feeder Quality flow meters that will output accurate measurements of a swimming pool’s rate of circulation make it easy to adjust the speed of a pump to the desired rate. It’s installed on one of the pipes, usually somewhere after the filter , as there’s virtually no obstructions in the water flow at this point. One of the two main specs for determining the pool pump size you need. However without a flow meter installed on your pool system you will not be able to start the process of calculating your filtration schedule since you will have no idea how much water your pump is moving at different rpm speeds. Now that we have the minimum and maximum flow rates for your pool setup, put them together to get to your flow rate range: If you’ve a heater installed the pool flow meter should be fitted between the filter and heater.</p>
