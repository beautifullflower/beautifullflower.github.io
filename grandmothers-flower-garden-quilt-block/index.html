A perennial favorite even before i became a quilter, there was one traditional quilt pattern that i recognized and knew the name of—it was the grandmother’s flower garden. Quilt the top and backing of the quilt together by stitching around the flower shape and the center of the flower. It just crossed my mind that this might be done when i am a grandmother myself.
