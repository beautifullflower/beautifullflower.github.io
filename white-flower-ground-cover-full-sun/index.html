<p>Gazania ringens White Ground cover plants, Full sun First on my list of full sun perennials is creeping phlox or moss phlox (phlox subulata). Vincas tolerate clay and sun exposure. Creeping phlox won�t become a rowdy neighbor to the tulips, daffodils, and other spring bulbs that look charming planted with it. This moss is not a moss at all, but is named so because it looks and spreads so much like it. The stamens grow from opposite sides to resemble a wishbone. Its heat and drought hardiness make it an obvious choice for tons of different climates.</p>
