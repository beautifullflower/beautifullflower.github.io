<p>Gazania ringens White Ground cover plants, Full sun First on my list of full sun perennials is creeping phlox or moss phlox (phlox subulata). Vincas tolerate clay and sun exposure. Creeping phlox wonï¿½t become a rowdy neighbor to the tulips, daffodils, and other spring bulbs that look charming planted with it. This moss is not a moss at all, but is named so because it looks and spreads so much like it. The stamens grow from opposite sides to resemble a wishbone. Its heat and drought hardiness make it an obvious choice for tons of different climates.</p>

<p>(monroviaplants) on Instagram âWith sparkling white This tenacious perennial spreads rapidly, thrives in full sun, is cold hardy, grows in poor soil, and is drought tolerant once established. If you plant this in full sun, youâll get the maximum amount of blossoms. Itâs drought tolerant, and evergreen in mild climates. If you have a garden that gets a lot of sun, then big root geraniums ( geranium macrorrhizum) can provide colorful ground cover. First on my list of full sun perennials is creeping phlox or moss phlox (phlox subulata). Theyï¿½re valuable for banks and slopes where they help retain soil and rainfall.</p>
