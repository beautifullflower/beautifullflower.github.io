<p>Raised Flower Bed Ideas Building A Raised Garden Bed With Tell us how it went. Lay the sleepers on their side to form the wall of the raised bed, building them up in a brick pattern if you�re using more than one layer. This is easier than it looks. Lay the sleepers on a level section of ground in a rectangular shape, with the narrowest sides on the ground and facing upwards. These sleepers should be placed on a ground that is firm and level. The first thing you will want to do is measure the area to where you will be laying the sleepers and cut them so that you can temporarily place them together to make that perfect square or rectangle.</p>
