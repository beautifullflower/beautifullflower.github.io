<p>The Nile forces its way through a tiny gap in the rocks Andrew johnston geographer, center for earth and planetary study, national air. One of the unique features about the nile river is the fact that it flows north, which is opposite the direction most rivers go. The nile�s two main tributaries are the blue and white nile rivers, which originate in ethiopia and eretria�s highlands and the equatorial lakes region, respectively. The atbara flows only while there is rain in ethiopia and dries very rapidly. The land falls away towards the north, thus the river flows north until it reaches the mediterranean sea at the nile delta. The new river is in many ways remarkable.</p>

The missouri river flows from the intermediate direction of north to south. Below the confluence with the blue nile the only major tributary is the atbara river, also known as the red nile, roughly halfway to the sea, which originates in ethiopia north of lake tana, and is around 800 kilometers (500 mi) long. It�s also one of the oldest rivers in the world, though, despite that, it was ironically named new, likely because it flowed away from the settled coastlands. The land falls away towards the north, thus the river flows north until it reaches the mediterranean sea at the nile delta.</p>
