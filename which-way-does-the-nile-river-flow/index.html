In the nileâs case, its source is lake victoria, located in the tanzania, uganda and kenya region of africa, at an elevation of 3,724 feet, or 3,955 miles to the center of the earth. Other names include aur, atbara, the white nile, yellow nile, and the blue nile.</p>

<p>Exploring Egypt and the Nile Egypt, Nile river cruise The white nile, the riverâs headwaters, flows from lake victoria and lake albert. Consequently, it doesnât matter if a river flows south to north, north to south, east to west, west to east or any direction in between, or which side of the planet it may be on, gravity and elevation are the primary ingredients in determining a riverâs course. In the nileâs case, its source is lake victoria, located in the tanzania, uganda and kenya region of africa, at an elevation of 3,724 feet, or 3,955 miles to the center of the earth. Some, like the snake river, flow several directions along their length. The red river in the u.s. The only river that does not flow from north to south is the nile river, and it flows from south to north.</p>

Direction of flow of a river is determined by elevation of the drainage basin, not geographical (north, south etc.) direction. The nile river flows northward and slightly to the west. Second, some people consider the direction north as being upward, though all rivers necessarily flow downward. The nile is distinctively vertical (longitudinal), and it is the only notable river on this planet to flow directly northward. The nile river flows from south to north, ending in the mediterranean sea.</p>
