Consequently, it doesn’t matter if a river flows south to north, north to south, east to west, west to east or any direction in between, or which side of the planet it may be on, gravity and elevation are the primary ingredients in determining a river’s course. In the nile’s case, its source is lake victoria, located in the tanzania, uganda and kenya region of africa, at an elevation of 3,724 feet, or 3,955 miles to the center of the earth. Some, like the snake river, flow several directions along their length. The red river in the u.s.

<p>Chris Hadfield on Chris hadfield, Earth from space It is believed that egypt who fully depend on the river always stir up political instability in ethiopia as a way of stopping them (ethiopia) from. Direction of flow of a river is determined by elevation of the drainage basin, not geographical (north, south etc.) direction. The nile river flows northward and slightly to the west. Second, some people consider the direction north as being upward, though all rivers necessarily flow downward. The nile is distinctively vertical (longitudinal), and it is the only notable river on this planet to flow directly northward.
