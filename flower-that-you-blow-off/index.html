We can eat any part of the flower — the leaves taste pretty good in a salad! If you have a hard time or feel like you’re going to pass out take a few breaths between each attempt. Taraxacum (or dandelion) legend (or enid blyton) has that if you count the number of blows it takes for all the seeds to come of you can tell the time of day.</p>
