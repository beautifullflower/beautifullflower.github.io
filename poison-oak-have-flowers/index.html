<p>Pin by Brenda McMichael Britton on Helpful Hints Poison oak often has leaves shaped like the leaves found on oak trees (thus the common name). The leaflets, which are arranged along the stem in pairs (figure 5), are oblong with sharply pointed tips and smooth or somewhat wavy edges. All three are members of the anacardiaceae family of plants and their leaves contain the syrupy sap urushiol that triggers an itchy, swollen, and painful reaction on the skin called contact dermatitis. When rivers flood during the winter, the western pond turtle takes to poison oak patches for shelter. Poison sumac leaves have seven to fifteen leaflets that are commonly 2 to 4 inches long and 3⁄4 to 2 inches wide. Poison ivy has flowers from spring to summer when the plant is blooming and recovering from the winter.</p>
