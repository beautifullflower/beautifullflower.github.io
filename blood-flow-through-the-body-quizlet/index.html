<p>The pulmonary artery carries the blood to the lungs where it circulates to dump the carbon dioxide and pick up oxygen which turns the blood bright red color. As blood moves through capillaries, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and waste are exchanged between blood and the fluid between cells. Blood flows in the following sequence in the heart: The pattern described below is repeated over and over, causing blood to flow continuously to the heart, lungs, and body. As blood is exiting the kidney, the filtrate travels out of the kidney through the ureters and on to the bladder to be stored until it will be excreted from the body.</p>

Blood flows in the following sequence in the heart: Microcirculation is the flow of blood from arterioles to capillaries or sinusoids to venules—the smallest vessels of the circulatory systemic. Blood flows from the right atrium #3 into the right ventricle #5 through the tricuspid valve. The flow of blood along arteries, arterioles, and capillaries is not constant, but can be controlled depending upon the requirements of the body. The heart is a key organ in the circulatory system responsible for the generation of pressure and thus flow throughout the system and pulmonary circulatory systems.</p>
