<p>Where focus goes energy follows Two Plus Luna Words Now that�s a subject for another day! “energy flows where attention goes.” if you want to see more of the things you desire in life, it’s important to make a conscious effort to be grateful for what you already have and always focus on what you want — and what you want to see more of — not on what you don’t want or the lack of something. It’s shifted from “feeling overwhelmed” to feeling like a badass. No more “oh you know, it’s hard to balance.” or “i feel overbooked.” blah, blah, blah. If you suddenly start to put focus towards something everything seems to be drawn towards it, this can work for good or bad and part of the principal behind the law of attraction; By that it means we can�t use energy forever and we have limited time to use energy for maximizing our inborn skill, when we don�t use energy properly, energy will stay away from us.</p>
