<p><strong>Blood Flow To The Brain Is Blocked When This Happens</strong>, Vertebrobasilar insufficiency is a condition characterized by poor blood flow to the posterior (back) portion of the brain, which is fed by two vertebral arteries that join to become the basilar artery. This can lead to loss of brain function or even death. Blood flow and the brain as the brain ages, it starts to shrink or “atrophy,” and the decrease in volume is considered a sign of brain aging, the researchers say in a news release.</p>

<p>The study revealed that 25 percent of the stroke patients had reduced blood flow in the back of the brain. As a result, the brain tissue in that area can die. But, scientists knew that the brain also depends upon the delivery of hormones and key nutrients , including glucose and several amino acids, from other organs of the body. When the carotid artery becomes blocked, blood flow to the brain can be interrupted. The most common vascular disease is atherosclerosis.</p>

If this blockage is only temporary, this leads to the appearance of an ischemic stroke (temporary lack of oxygen and nutrients in the area). When a blood clot travels at the level of the brain, reaching a more or less important artery, it can cause a blockage. In addition to the damage to the brain cells near the rupture, the rupture will cause other areas of the brain to not get enough blood, and that lack of blood can damage those brain cells.
