<p>circular flow Economics lessons, Teaching economics Introduction the circular flow of income shows connections between different sectors. The payment flow between the two sectors and two markets is conveniently divided into four segments representing consumption expenditures, gross domestic product, factor payments, and national income.

The flows of money between the sectors are also tracked to measure a countryâs national income or gdp. In opposite direction to this, money flows from business firms. Firms provide factor payments in exchange of their factor services. The model represents all of the actors in an economy as either households or firms (companies), and it divides markets into two categories: A simple circular flow model of the macro economics containing two sectors (business and household) and two markets (product and factor) that illustrates the continuous movement of the payments for goods and services between producers and consumers.</p>

<p>Pin on Economics (general) The idea of the circular flow was already present in the work of richard cantillon. The circular flow analysis is the basis of national accounts and hence of macroeconomics. In opposite direction to this, money flows from business firms.
