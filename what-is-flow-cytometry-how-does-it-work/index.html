<p>Cytometry is the measurement of cell characteristics. So, what is a flow cytometer? In this process, a sample containing cells or particles is suspended in a fluid and injected into the flow cytometer instrument. The sample is focused to ideally flow one cell at a time through a laser beam, where the light scattered is characteristic to. Cytometry, in its purest form, is the measurement of cell characteristics, which can include cell size, cell count, cell cycle and more.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-flow-cytometry-work">How does flow cytometry work?</h3><p>Most flow cytometry is analytical: The multiple characteristics measured include the particle size, the internal complexity of granularity, and relative fluorescence intensity. In this process, a sample containing cells or particles is suspended in a fluid and injected into the flow cytometer instrument. One of the fundamentals of flow cytometry is the ability to measure the properties of individual particles.

Flow cytometry is an indispensable tool for diagnosis and monitoring of leukemia and lymphoma. The same question would take days of work to answer by western blot. Flow cytofluorometry (fc) can be contrasted with fluorescence microscopy (fm). A countless number of interesting flow cytometry experiments can be designed including subtle stages of the cell cycle, various apoptotic states, or organelle integrity.

How does flow cytometry work? Flow cytometry is a technology used to measure and analyze the physical characteristics of single particles (cells) flowing in a fluid through a beam of light. Flow cytometry can be used for detecting numerous targets either on the surface or within cells in the same sample. This technique allows researchers to gather data on a large number of individual cells, which can then be independently analyzed.</p>
