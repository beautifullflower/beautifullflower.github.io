<p>ljekovito bilje Plants, Dark star, Garden Honey extractors are expensive and difficult to lug from place to place when sharing with friends, neighbors or a bee association.

This became possible by producing premade cells to the bees and when it’s time to harvest all it requires is just to split the cells. Unlike traditional hives, you do not need to smoke the bees and spend hours extracting honey with a flow hive. It seems to be a big savings in labor costs, and all the handling to the honey house, then all the mess to extract, clean up and return the frames to the hives, unless you have extra frames to exchange.</p>
