<p><strong>How Does Blood Flow Through The Heart</strong>, The heart acts as a pump to distribute oxygenated blood throughout the body. The circulation system has two blood flow pipelines. The cardiovascular or circulatory system is an important organ system of your body as it makes the blood flow through the heart, so it can transport oxygen, hormones, carbon dioxide, blood cells and nutrients to and from your body cells for nourishing the body, helping it fight diseases, stabilizing ph and temperature and maintaining homeostasis.for all these activities to take place, it is important the heart blood flow remains smooth and constant.</p>

<p>Blood flow through the heart. The blood then flows through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. The pattern described below is repeated over and over (heart rhythm), causing blood to flow continuously to the heart, lungs, and body to supply oxygen and nutrients to the body cells and to deliver waste products to organs that remove them from your body. After picking up oxygen, the blood travels back to the heart through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium, to the left ventricle and out to the bodyï¿½s tissues through the aorta. The blood flows from the vena cavas into the first top room, called the right atrium.</p>
<h3 id="the-two-big-veins-attached-to-the-heart-care-called-the-vena-cavas">The two big veins attached to the heart care called the vena cavas.</h3><p>The pulmonary artery carries blood to the lungs where it âpicks upâ oxygen and then leaves the lungs to return to the heart through the pulmonary vein. This newly oxygenated blood goes through the left side and out the aorta, the main artery going from the heart to the body. Blood transports oxygen and nutrients to the body. Blood flows through your heart and lungs in four steps: The pulmonary artery carries blood to the lungs where it âpicks upâ oxygen and then leaves the lungs to return to the heart through the pulmonary vein.</p>

Blood flow through the heart. Next the blood enters the lungs and performs gas exchange, the blood now has high o2 and goes to the pulmonary vein back towards the heart. The blood comes back to the heart through two big tubes called veins. It transports deoxygenated blood to the lungs to absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. It requires a joint functioning of all the cardiac chambers to make proper circulation possible.</p>

Beginning with the superior and inferior vena cavae and the coronary sinus, the flowchart below summarizes the flow of blood through the heart, including all arteries, veins, and valves that are passed along the way. In this educational lesson, we learn about the blood flow order through the human heart in 14 easy steps, from the superior and inferior vena cava to the atria and ventricles. For better illustration, look at the picture below and note how the right and left side are separated. Blood flows through your heart and lungs in four steps: Blood leaves the heart through the pulmonic valve, into the pulmonary artery and to the lungs.</p>

The blood comes back to the heart through two big tubes called veins. This is how blood flows through left side of the heart: Blood from the pulmonary vasculature enters the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. As the ventricle contracts, blood leaves the heart through the pulmonic valve, into the pulmonary artery and to the lungs, where it is oxygenated. The blood then flows through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.</p>

<p>Circulation of blood through the heart (diagram) School The pattern described below is repeated over and over (heart rhythm), causing blood to flow continuously to the heart, lungs, and body to supply oxygen and nutrients to the body cells and to deliver waste products to organs that remove them from your body. Always remember that it must flow through 6 areas on the right side and then 6 areas on the left side (this equals 12 steps). As the atrium contracts, blood flows from your left atrium. This video describes how blood flows in and out of the heart. When the heart beats, the ventricle pushes blood through the pulmonic valve into the pulmonary artery. The ventricles are in a low pressure (p) state during early diastole as they are relaxed and not contracting.</p>
