<p><strong>How Does Blood Flow Through The Heart</strong>, The heart acts as a pump to distribute oxygenated blood throughout the body. The circulation system has two blood flow pipelines. The cardiovascular or circulatory system is an important organ system of your body as it makes the blood flow through the heart, so it can transport oxygen, hormones, carbon dioxide, blood cells and nutrients to and from your body cells for nourishing the body, helping it fight diseases, stabilizing ph and temperature and maintaining homeostasis.for all these activities to take place, it is important the heart blood flow remains smooth and constant.</p>

<p>Blood flow through the heart. The blood then flows through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. The pattern described below is repeated over and over (heart rhythm), causing blood to flow continuously to the heart, lungs, and body to supply oxygen and nutrients to the body cells and to deliver waste products to organs that remove them from your body. After picking up oxygen, the blood travels back to the heart through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium, to the left ventricle and out to the body�s tissues through the aorta. The blood flows from the vena cavas into the first top room, called the right atrium.</p>
<h3 id="the-two-big-veins-attached-to-the-heart-care-called-the-vena-cavas">The two big veins attached to the heart care called the vena cavas.</h3><p>The pulmonary artery carries blood to the lungs where it “picks up” oxygen and then leaves the lungs to return to the heart through the pulmonary vein. This newly oxygenated blood goes through the left side and out the aorta, the main artery going from the heart to the body. Blood transports oxygen and nutrients to the body. Blood flows through your heart and lungs in four steps: The pulmonary artery carries blood to the lungs where it “picks up” oxygen and then leaves the lungs to return to the heart through the pulmonary vein.</p>
