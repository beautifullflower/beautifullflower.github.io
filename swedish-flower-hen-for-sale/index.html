<p>Pin on Hühner Swedish flower chickens are so named due to the white or black flecks/flowers on the tips of their feathers. There are thought to be around 2,000 birds now in existence worldwide. The swedish flower hen is one of the traditional breeds of sweden—as well as the largest native chicken to sweden—and was most likely used for both meat and egg production. Swedish flowers lay a good number of pale cream eggs. Very few swedes even know of the existence of this breed. They originated in the southern most province of skane.</p>

<p>Swedish Flower Chickens have tons of diversity to them As a landrace, this breed was not intentionally created by a breeder carefully selecting birds as part of a structured breeding program. The breed is over 300 years old. I hatched a handful during the late fall to see how they would turn out and was very pleased with the results. The swedish flower is a landrace, meaning the birds were not selected by breeders for a specific color or feature but were allowed to naturally select. They are known and named for their flowers or white lacing on the tips of their feathers. Each bird is unique in color and pattern making this making this breed the perfect backyard flock choice.</p>
