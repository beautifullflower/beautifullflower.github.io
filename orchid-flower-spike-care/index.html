This will encourage new flower spikes to grow. If the orchid has stem is completely severed or dangling by a thread, the best thing to do is to start fresh and cut off the damaged portion. This is the step in which you want to be the most careful, because if you bend the spike too much while securing it to the stake it could break off entirely (this is why you need to insert the stake into the pot as close to the spike as you can get it: Terminal flower spikes are flower stems that appear in the middle or center of the crown of your phalaenopsis orchid, hindering any more future growth, be it a leaf, a spike or further stem growth.

When the last flower fades, you can leave the spike (stem) on and it will still continue flowering but the stem gets very ungainly and the flowers get smaller. The just add ice orchid may produce new buds at the end of the old flower spike.</p>
