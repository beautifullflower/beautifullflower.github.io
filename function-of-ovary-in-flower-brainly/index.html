<!--html tag code -->
<p><strong>Function Of Ovary In Flower Brainly</strong>, Carpel is the female reproductive organ of a flower which has the fertilized ovules that are changing into seeds. In the event of a favorable pollination where a compatible pollen reaches the stigma and eventually reaches the ovary to fuse with the ovules, this fertilized product forms the fruit and the ovules become the seeds of the fruit. Once the pollen lands on the stigma, it is passed downwards through the style to the ovary.</p>

However, both are not functional in all animals (e.g., birds and some fish species ). The number of eggs produced by each species differs, with fish and.
