<p>Pin by Amber Jackson Hames on Garden Sanctuary Flower Weed seeds can quickly transfer to your flower bed by the wind and through bird or animal droppings. Put on your oh so sexy work gloves. If they’re too difficult to remove, chop off their heads. There is a special colored gravel base for flower beds. Although it won�t get rid of existing weeds (you�ll need to remove those first), this preen weed preventer will help stop new weeds from cropping up in flower beds and lasts up to three months. Like newspapers, cardboards also act as weed barriers to many homeowners.</p>
