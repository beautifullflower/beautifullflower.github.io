<p>Yellow flower Silver Bells And Cockle Shells And pretty 15 february 2009 at 23:10 post a comment. Seemed to have it all in one! I was reading the nursery rhyme mary quite contrary, and it turns out the plant names were real; Lady bells and cowslips are both types of plants. With silver bells and cockleshells One theory is that it is religious allegory of catholicism, with mary being mary, the mother of jesus, bells representing the sanctus bells, the cockleshells the badges of the pilgrims to the shrine of saint james in spain (santiago de compostela) and pretty maids are nuns, but even within this strand of thought there are differences of opinion as to whether it is lament for the reinstatement of catholicism or for its persecution.</p>
