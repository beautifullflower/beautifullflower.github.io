The job of the mass air flow sensor is to keep track of the amount of air coming in through the air filter, so that the ecu can adjust the amount of fuel getting into the engine. So, if you want a maf sensor that takes care of fuel consumption as well, get this one installed in your vehicle.</p>

<p>Pin on Projects to Try Locate the mass airflow sensor next to the engine air filter. Too much air and not enough fuel will cause the engine to. This drawing shows the location of the map sensor next to the throttle body assembly. Mass airflow sensors, or maf sensors for short, measure the density of the air passing through an engine’s intake and report to the ecu (engine control unit) computer, allowing it to deliver the right amount of fuel through the injectors and into the combustion chambers. When not used, that job falls on the map sensor. The ecu uses this information to calculate engine load, which the ecu uses along with information provided by the oxygen sensor(s) to precisely control the engine’s air / fuel ratio.</p>

<p>0610 PT CRUISER FUSE RELAY BOX TIPM TOTALLY INTEGRATED A mass air flow sensor monitors the air coming in through the air intake system so that the vehicle�s electronic control unit (ecu) can make adjustments to the air/fuel ratio. Press the connector, then pull it to unplug it from the maf sensor. The way it does this is rather ingenious. Remove the two torx bolts that hold the sensor in place. When replacing, inspect the plastic intake air ducts for cracks or dry rot. To detach the connector, push down on the tabs and pull it straight out.</p>
