<p>Mass airflow sensors (maf) report the amount or density (mass) of the air entering the engine to the powertrain control module (pcm). The mass air flow (maf) sensor, measures the volume and density, of the air entering the engine. What does a mass air flow sensor do in a car, truck, suv? There actually are a few different types, of mass air flow (maf) sensors. The fuel injection computer then uses this air flow measurement (along with other input sensor information) to calculate the amount of fuel to inject into the engine.</p>
<h3 id="not-only-does-it-work-hard-but-its">Not only does it work hard, but it’s.</h3><p>The mass air flow sensor measures the air mass flowing into the engine intake. When the device goes bad, it can lead to various symptoms, ranging from an illuminated check engine light to rough running and misfiring.

We have gathered lots of pictures, ideally this picture is useful for you, and aid you in discovering the solution you are looking for. The mass air flow sensor is quite a complex little component of multiport fuel injection systems with a critical role in the performance of your engine. A faulty maf sensor can cause your vehicle to run too rich or run too lean. The air mass information is necessary for the ecu to correctly balance and deliver the correct amount of fuel to the engine.</p>

<p>Pin on Flow Measurement How do mass air flow sensors work? Your vehicle’s mass air flow sensor (also called “maf”) works by heating up a thin wire to check the volume of air entering the engine. Since the function of an maf is to measure all the air flowing into the engine, they have a lot of air flowing through them. You can bypass the maf sensor , and allow the o2 sensor to calculate how much air is needed. You’ll notice if the tailpipes eject black smoke or when the engine runs.
