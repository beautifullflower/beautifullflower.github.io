<p>Parts and functions of a plant! Second grade Pinterest Seeds come in all sizes shapes and colors depending on the type of plant. The stamen has two parts. Flowers provide nectar to certain birds and insects, which in turn help in the transfer of pollen from one flower to the other. After pollination occurs, the flower develops seeds. Along with reproduction, flowers are also a rich source of food for other living organisms such as insects, birds, animals and humans. However, it is used mainly as a way to attract insects to help pollinate the seed.</p>
