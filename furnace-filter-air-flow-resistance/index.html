<p>Merv rating &amp; air flow efficiency, honeywell furnace filters for hvac systems the installation of honeywell furnace filters represents a significant defense in bolstering the overall efficiency and quality of airflow within the household. A cheap fiberglass filter, for example, is great for air flow but bad for particle control. Always follow your filter sizing guidelines to ensure that you choose the right sized filter for your furnace. When it passes through your merv pleated air filter, it improves the air in your environment. (flow rate equals area times velocity;</p>
