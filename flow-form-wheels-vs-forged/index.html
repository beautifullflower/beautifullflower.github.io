<p><strong>Flow Form Wheels Vs Forged</strong>, Flow forming creates a very light, strong wheel that delivers a performance edge over a cast or low pressure cast wheels thanks to the unique properties endowed by the unique flow forging process. An aluminum wheel is first cast for the face and the initial stage of the process. This allows the wheel to be much lighter, stronger, have a greater resistance to shock, and a higher load capacity when compared to cast wheels.</p>

<p>Flow forming creates a very light, strong wheel that delivers a performance edge over a cast or low pressure cast wheels thanks to the unique properties endowed by the unique flow forging process. Flow forming also increases elongation, or the amount that a wheel is able to flex before arriving at a breaking point, an important safety feature if you’re smashing curbs at the race track or. This methodology is also referred to as flow forged or forged hybrid. We specialize in double takes! At pk auto design, we simply love cars.</p>
<h3 id="the-vertini-vs17-uses-forging-techniques-to-make-wheels-lighter-than-traditional-casting-techniques-without-sacrificing-the-strength-or-durability">The vertini vs17 uses forging techniques to make wheels lighter than traditional casting techniques without sacrificing the strength or durability.</h3><p>I�ve personally bought the 18 tsts which will be my new summer wheels on my lr rwd 3. This methodology is also referred to as flow forged or forged hybrid. The reality is there is nothing forged about these wheels. Our lightweight technology produces wheels that are lighter in weight compared to a conventional cast construction, yet substantially stronger. Since the material is formed, the grain structure is long, and continuous.</p>

To summarize, remember that cast wheels are cheap but good enough for street use, forged wheels are expensive but will hold up to anything you throw at them, and flow formed wheels are between cast and forged.
