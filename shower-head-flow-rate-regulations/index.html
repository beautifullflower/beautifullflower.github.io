Depending on where you live, retailers may only sell shower heads with a maximum of 2.5 gpm, 2.0 gpm, or 1.8 gpm flow rate. A flow rate that is above 15 litres per minute will be regarded as good. Since 1992, federal regulations have mandated that no shower head can have a flow rate higher than 2.5 gpm, and in some states like california, that limit is even lower at 1.8 gpm.</p>

Since 1992, federal law has dictated that showerheads shouldn’t spew more than 2.5 gallons (9.5 liters) of water a minute. Further, large retailers may only sell the lowest flows available to simplify product stocking and shipping requirements, and comply with government regulations. Current rules, established in 1994 at the federal level, allow a maximum flow of 2.5 gallons per minute from a shower head. This means no more than 2.5 gallons of water should flow out each minute. Since 1992, federal law has dictated that new showerheads shouldn’t pour more than 2.5 gallons of water per minute (9.5 liters).</p>

Since 1992, a maximum of 2.5 gpm is the federally mandated flow rate for new shower heads. The gpm flow rate for shower heads has decreased over time.

You may think that 2.0 gpm of water flow is at low as it goes, but that�s not so. Since 1992, federal law has dictated that showerheads shouldn’t spew more than 2.5 gallons (9.5 liters) of water a minute.</p>
