<p>These types of lava flow can form lava tubs. Pahoehoe is a smooth and continuous lava crust. Pāhoehoe (from hawaiian [paːˈhoweˈhowe], meaning smooth, unbroken lava), also spelled pahoehoe, is basaltic lava that has a smooth, billowy, undulating, or ropy surface. In contrast to pāhoehoe, aʻā lava: It creates interesting shapes and natural sculptures across the landscape.</p>
<h3 id="pahoehoe-lava-flows-are-characterized-by-smooth-gently-undulating-or-broadly-hummocky-surfaces">Pahoehoe lava flows are characterized by smooth, gently undulating, or broadly hummocky surfaces.</h3><p>Pahoehoe lava flows are fed almost wholly internally by streams of liquid lava flowing beneath a solidified or partly solidified surface. Typically, the margin of a pahoehoe flow advances by protruding one small toe or lobe after another. One, pahoehoe, refers to lava with a smooth, shiny, or swirled surface and comes from the hawaiian verb hoe, to paddle (since paddles make swirls in the water). Thus the temperature and viscosity of lava do not change very much even tens of kilometers from the vent. Pahoehoe lava flows are highly fluid, flowing easily.</p>

Pahoehoe forms when the effusion rate is low and consequently the velocity of lava flow is slow 2.pahoehoe lava flow is usually at least 10 times slower than typical aa lava flow 5.higher effusion rate results in lava flow being shattered which is how the rubbly and clinkery aa lava surface forms. One, pahoehoe, refers to lava with a smooth, shiny, or swirled surface and comes from the hawaiian verb hoe, to paddle (since paddles make swirls in the water). This happens because of the delicate balance of gas content in the lava, the changes in lava viscosity, and the. Pahoehoe (pronounced like “pah hoy hoy”) is a smooth lava produced when lava flows slowly and gently. These terms being used in this sense in hawaii, in relation to the local lavas.</p>

Pahoehoe (pronounced like “pah hoy hoy”) is a smooth lava produced when lava flows slowly and gently. Pahoehoe forms when the effusion rate is low and consequently the velocity of lava flow is slow 2.pahoehoe lava flow is usually at least 10 times slower than typical aa lava flow 5.higher effusion rate results in lava flow being shattered which is how the rubbly and clinkery aa lava surface forms. Pahoehoe is a smooth and continuous lava crust. However, as in the fable of the tortoise and the hare, it is the slow but unrelenting pahoehoe lava flows that ultimately grow larger and longer than the.</p>
