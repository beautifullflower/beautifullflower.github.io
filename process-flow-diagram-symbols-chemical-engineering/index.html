<p>instrumentation technician chart Google Search A chemical process flow diagram (pfd) is a specialized type of flowchart. It is a type of flow chart that is utilized in chemical engineering and process engineering. It�s most often used in chemical engineering and process engineering, though its concepts are sometimes applied to other processes as well. A chemical process flow diagram (pfd) is a specialized type of flowchart. The pfd contains the bulk of the chemical engineering data necessary for the design of a chemical process. It illustrates the general plant streams, major equipments and key control loops.</p>
