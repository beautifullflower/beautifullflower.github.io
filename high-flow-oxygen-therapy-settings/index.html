<p>High flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy has been widely used in critically ill patients. The policy applies to physiotherapists, nurses, doctors and nursing associates. Physical examination should be undertaken urgently. Oxygen is a drug and should be prescribed on the drug kardex according to a target saturation range. Respiratory failure is distressing for patients and treatment modalities currently in use may be associated with discomfort from upper airway drying, tightly fitting facemasks, and resultant complications such as skin breakdown.</p>
