Achieve successful orchid cactus care with an optimal balance of water, humidity and light. With minimal care, they will flourish and bloom again and again, whether in your home or at the office :) light. The orchid is entering a temporary resting stage where it will start to stockpile energy before producing the next bloom. Orchids need ample water but should be allowed to dry out some between waterings. Once the flower is finished, you can cut its stem back to about an inch above the planting line and continue watering as usual.</p>

<p>Lola McGinnis Color of the Year radiantorchid Purple With minimal care, they will flourish and bloom again and again, whether in your home or at the office :) light. Orchids need ample water but should be allowed to dry out some between waterings. To care for a dendrobium orchid, start by planting it in a small pot with a soilless potting medium like fir bark or moss. Orchids usually remain in bloom for six to 10 weeks. Water the orchid infrequently, being guided by the plant, rather than watering on a schedule. Just like our skin, orchid leaves can get sunburnt by overexposure to direct sunlight.</p>
