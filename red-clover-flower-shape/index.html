<p>Pin by Just Dreamin� on lucky clover farm in 2020 Wild Clover or trefoil are common names for plants of the genus trifolium, consisting of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume or pea family fabaceae originating in europe. For this reason, there should be a four year gap between the red clover crops. Red clover can spread through the actions of stock passing the hard seed. Generally this variety is smaller and lower yielding than an agriculturally bred strain, but with a longer lifespan. Red clover is often dismissed as a “weed” but this small plant has been used traditionally for years for its edible and medicinal qualities. This herbal perennial in the pea family ( fabaceae , also known as leguminosae ) roots itself with a long taproot and rises up with a slender, hollow, and hairy stem.</p>

<p>Hanging Red Geode Flower Wall Art Hanging Goldenrod Identifying characteristics the trifoliate leaves and pink to red flowers are both key features that help in the identification of red clover. Red clover is more susceptible than other species to the soil borne disease sclerotinia trifolium and the stem nematode, ditylenchus dipsaci, responsible for the widespread clover sickness in the 1970s and 80s. Unlike the white clover, red clover is usually an erect plant with a hairy stem, sometimes branching. The stipules of zigzag clover are narrow throughout. Red clover initiates growth from the plant crown. Its green leaves have a white or pale green chevron on the upper side which helps to guide pollinator insects to the flower head.</p>

Red clover leaflets are approximately 3/4 inches across and 2 inches long. The common name for trifolium pratense, red clover, can be confusing as the flowers are more a pink to pink/purplish, not a true red. Unlike the white clover, red clover is usually an erect plant with a hairy stem, sometimes branching. Despite being lower yielding than some varieties, it is notably early to flower, often seen from april to may. Plants have hollow, hairy stems and branches.</p>
