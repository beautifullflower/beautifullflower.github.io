<p><strong>Spider Lily Flowering Season</strong>, Best flowering occurs in full sun or light shade for most lycoris species except lycoris radiata (red spider lily) which thrives in partial shade (especially in hot climates). Thin, delicate petals and long stamens result in blooms that resemble spider legs. Spider lilies take about three to four months to germinate from bulb to flowering adult, typically reaching a height somewhere between two and three feet with a spread of around a foot or less.</p>
