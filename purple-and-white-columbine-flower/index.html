<p>Pin on Plant Cultivars Spring Perenniels 5 out of 5 stars. Plants are tall, up to 30 inches. A beautiful perennial wildflower, the columbine is a hardy flower that will bloom in partial shade or even in a woodland setting. Though they easily spread, they can be trained to grow in a more compact space with new blooms through regular pruning. The photos are all from my garden. This flower is perfect if you want to attract hummingbirds to your garden.</p>
