<p>Front Bleeder Light Flow Menstrual Cloth Pad PDF Sewing A light or scanty period is a flow of reduced blood. Your body will initially treat the iud as a foreign object resulting in the heavy menstrual flow. Here’s how taking the pill affects your period and changes your menstrual cycle. The hormonal content of the pill that prevents pregnancy also aligns your period. In case you have recently stopped taking the pill, you could experience heavier periods, as the pill often makes your period to be lighter; When in doubt, take a pregnancy.</p>

Implantation spotting occurs ten days after you ovulate or 4 days to a week before your next period. A light period is when someone has less menstrual blood or a shorter period than usual. I came off the pill last july. If you get an iud for the first time, you could experience a heavy period flow in the initial months. If you notice light period that is earlier than normal, then it may be due to pregnancy.</p>
