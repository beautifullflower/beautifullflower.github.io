<p>Weeki Wachee Springs are the headwaters of the Weeki It is popular with local whitewater kayakers as well as several rowing clubs and pleasure craft. Speed probably varies from about 3 ½ to 7 miles per hour. 1.6 to 3.1 m/s This is because the outside bend is where the river flows fastest and is most energetic, so lots of erosion by hydraulic action and corrasion takes place. The river corrib in the west of ireland flows from lough corrib through galway to galway bay. The water flows fastest around the outside of the bend, and slower on the inside. Water moving faster has more energy to erode;</p>
