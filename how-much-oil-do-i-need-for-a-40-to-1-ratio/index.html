For a 32:1 mixture, use 4 fluid ounces of oil per gallon of gas. Those ratio�s are suggesting that the mix should be either 50 parts gasoline to 1 part oil or 40 parts gas to 1 part oil so the 40:1 mix will smoke more because it has a higher oil to gas ratio. The larger number represents the amount of gasoline, while the smaller is the amount of oil needed. Never use fuel that contains more than 10% of ethanol, as many small engines aren’t equipped to handle that ingredient.</p>
