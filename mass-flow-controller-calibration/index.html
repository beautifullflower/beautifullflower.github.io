<p>NIST Traceability Tools Watch this recorded web seminar on the operation and calibration of mass flow controllers. These controllers may be used as benchtop units or mounted by means of screws in the base. Digital mass flow meters &amp; mass flow controllers for gases. Gfc mass flow controllers are available with flow ranges from 10 sccm to 1000 sl/min n2. This versatile instrument can control flow into a closed volume and then control flow in the other direction to exhaust the volume. For micro to low flow rates of liquids, we offer mass flow meters and controllers, based on the thermal and coriolis measuring principle as well as volumetric flow meters based on ultrasonic, vortex, electromagnetic and positive displacement working principles.</p>
