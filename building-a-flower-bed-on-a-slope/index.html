Be sure to check for level from front to back. Spring bulbs and other flowering plants often work very effectively in foundation beds. Measure a line to find the length of the slope. The side board connects at the top of the front and the bottom of the back, kind of like stairs.</p>

<p>Great step by step post on building a flower bed I In the picture below, the bed was 4” below level, so i was able to use a 2” x 4” piece for the tapers. At the corners of the raised bed, turn one paver 90 degrees so that its width completes the end of the row. Measure a line to find the length of the slope. The ideal location will need adequate drainage. I had a perennial garden on a slope. The bottom boards are just set to as close to level as possible.the bottom side is about a couple of inches.</p>

<p>Wood and gravel steps with flower bed. Gravel They can be set on the dirt as long as the boxes are level. Separating the colors in a flower bed creates a sense of organization and order to your garden. If your yard is uneven, you can use varying levels of flower beds to follow the slope of your yard. Dig into the slope to create a trench around the area where the flower bed will be located. Leave the stakes in place, but. Layer the paper at least six pages deep, then cover the newspaper with several inches of rich soil or compost.</p>

<p>How to Build a Terraced Garden Bed on a Slope YouTube In the picture below, the bed was 4” below level, so i was able to use a 2” x 4” piece for the tapers. The first step of the project is to make the frame of the flower bed. The ground is uneven, however, and slopes downhill in a southward direction. Be sure to check for level from front to back. Plant roots are very efficient at anchoring loose soil on a sloped flower bed. So, i decided on 2×8 beds…for now anyway.</p>
