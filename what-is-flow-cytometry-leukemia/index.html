Flow cytometry is a technique used to detect and measure physical and chemical characteristics of a population of cells or particles. This test is usually done after abnormal results are seen on a complete blood count or wbc differential. Flow cytometric immunophenotpying (fci) is a vital tool in the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia (hcl). Hcl has a distinctive immunophenotype based upon staining with antibodies to cd5 (negative), cd10 (negative), cd23 (negative), cd20 (abnormally bright), cd22 (abnormally bright), cd11c (abnormally bright), cd25 (abnormally bright), cd103 (positive), and cd123 (positive). Cd25, cd11c and cd103 are coexpressed on these cells.</p>
