<p>In order to understand how that happens it is necessary to understand the anatomy and physiology of the heart. The heart is a key organ in the circulatory system responsible for the generation of pressure and thus flow throughout the system and pulmonary circulatory systems. At the same time blood returns from the lungs via the pulmonary veins into the l atrium. In the opposite way, the parasympathetic nervous system can decrease the heart rate, which. The chambers are separated by a wall of tissue called the septum.</p>
