<p>Just changed our front flower beds to this river rock and I knew from experience in our past house that flower bed rocks would keep/stay much better than mulch, so we decided to go for it. Mulching serves a critical function in temperature and moisture moderation. One of the changes we made was to replace all the mulch around the patio with river rocks and, possibly, all the flower beds with rocks instead of mulch. Pros and cons of organic mulch pros. Use bricks, large stones or plastic edging. Using rocks for landscaping can be very beneficial.</p>

<p>Here we used river rock instead of mulch. Makes for a I prefer the natural look of mulch (undyed) but what i really appreciate is its ability to retain moisture, and surpress weed when several inches deep. The fact that it breaks down and feeds the plants and adds organic material improving the soil is an added bonus. Especially avoid rocks around common foundation plants like azalea, hydrangea, and yews; Rock flower beds are durable. Gravel is heavy, making diy installation difficult; When compared to mulch, flower beds with rocks offer a longer life.</p>
