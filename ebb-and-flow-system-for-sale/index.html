<p>Make a Bell Siphon Bell siphon, Aquaponics, How to make Growace.com is a leader in hydroponics equiptment. The ebb and flow or flood and drain method works by flooding the grow area with nutrient solution at specific intervals, which then drain back into a reservoir containing a pump on a timer. Ebb and flow tables are the industry standard for propagating seedlings in a modern greenhouse. The medium is primarily for stabilizing the plant and is not required to have any nutritional value. (the water is, of course, mixed with nutrients.) a thin film will adhere to the gravel allowing the plant roots to gather nutrients even after the container has been drained. Basically, water and air don’t occupy the same space at the same time in the medium, and because of this, we use the timing of irrigations to find an optimal balance between the air and water content of the medium over time.</p>
