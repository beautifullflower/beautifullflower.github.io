It is perfectly normal for plants to eventually have their lower leaves turn yellow. Leaves lose their glossy appearance and seem to flatten. Some of the causes include inadequate light conditions, insufficient humidity, too much or too little water, or too much fertilizer.

After the blooming is a great time to repot, so you can check the health of the roots and cut off any rotten ones. It is also during this dormancy period that your orchid will prepare for a new blooming season.</p>
