<p>The flow of energy in the food chain of an ecosystem. It flows from one trophic level to another trophic level inside a food chain. The placement of the arrows in a food chain or food web is very important. It can�s also flow back from consumers to producers, it will flow from producers to consumers and is not in reverse direction. The arrows always show the direction of the energy as it is transferred from one organism to another.</p>
<h3 id="the-amount-of-energy-that-moves-from-one-feeding-level-to-another-in-a-food-web">The amount of energy that moves from one feeding level to another in a food web.</h3><p>Energy flows progressively from one trophic level to another and cannot revert back. So, the energy that is captured by the producers does not revert back to the sun and the energy transferred to the herbivores does not come back to the producers. Food chain tells us how energy is transferred from one organism to another. The flow of energy in the food chain of an ecosystem.

Food chain notes energy flows through an ecosystem in one direction along a food chain the sun is the main source of energy for life on earth plants use energy from sun to make food (photosynthesis) plants are autotrophs (self feeders) because they make their own food animals are heterotrophs.

In some ecosystems more energy flows through the detritus food chain than through grazing food chain. Food chain tells us how energy is transferred from one organism to another. In order to more efficiently show the quantity of organisms at each trophic level, these food chains are then organized into trophic pyramids. Biotic and abiotic factors in an area.</p>

<p>Some Parts of the Food Chain Producers, Consumers The total amount of energy fixed by plants is gross primary production. The flow of this energy is unidirectional, i.e., it flows in one direction—from the producers to the consumers at successively higher trophic levels. That is why the flow of energy in the food chain is always unidirectional. Arrows on a food chain, or food web, represent the flow of energy. It is a linear sequence of organisms (i.e. So, the energy that is captured by the producers does not revert back to the sun and the energy transferred to the herbivores does not come back to the producers.</p>

It can�s also flow back from consumers to producers, it will flow from producers to consumers and is not in reverse direction. The energy in the form of radiant heat and light from the sun lows through an ecosystem passing through the different trophic levels (links) and radiates again back into outer space. The placement of the arrows in a food chain or food web is very important. In order to more efficiently show the quantity of organisms at each trophic level, these food chains are then organized into trophic pyramids.</p>
