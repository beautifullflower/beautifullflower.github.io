<p>Tips For Preventing Bolting In Broccoli Plants Broccoli These can be flowers you grow yourself in the garden or edible flowers from the farmer’s market and the grocery store. The bright yellow broccoli flowers are edible and delicious. You just have to know how to cook with them. So that’s why it’s my number 10 because it is not my favorite. These tasty little morsels are perfectly edible and great for tossing into salads, wraps, and other fresh entrees, but are actually a bit of a tease to gardeners waiting on full heads of broccoli. It is considered an annual plant, although some gardeners have been able to coax regrowth of some varieties, making these perennial.</p>

<p>Broccoli Leaves Are Edible Garden Betty in 2020 Those little yellow flowers are edible, too. Broccoli is a member of the cole crop or brassicaceae family, and as such, has a number of insects that enjoy the tasty head as much as we do. The flower buds are cooked and eaten like broccoli raab, and the edible flowers can be eaten raw or used as a garnish. The very word can send children screaming in terror and cause adults to tremble in fear. These tiny yellow clusters of flowers are just as edible as the tight broccoli head. It�s a better garnish then it is a part of your salad but actually taste fine as well.</p>
