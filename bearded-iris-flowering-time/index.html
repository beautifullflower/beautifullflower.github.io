<p>Photo of Tall Bearded Iris (Iris �I I Stutter�) uploaded In late spring tulips and peonies are flowering and this is the time when the bearded iris type flowers. Very short bearded iris will flower earlier, before peonies, and the taller bearded iris flower at about the same time as peonies. Shirley says the most common reason iris aren’t producing flowers is lack of sun. Here is a list of spectacular bearded irises with blooms starting between early may and early june. This will be followed by flowering of tall bearded iris varieties starting to flower in early october. The timing of division is very different than that of most perennials, because bearded irises go dormant shortly after flowering, and summer is the ideal time to dig up the rhizomes.</p>

<p>�Bernice�s Legacy� Bearded Iris Easy to grow bulbs Reblooming varieties will produce flowers once in summer and again in fall. Please note that bearded irises may not bloom the first year after planting. Iris grows from a thick root called a rhizome, which continues to grow and expand each year. Their peak flowering time in melbourne is october and november, depending on the heat. Some types even rebloom in late summer and fall. The timing of division is very different than that of most perennials, because bearded irises go dormant shortly after flowering, and summer is the ideal time to dig up the rhizomes.</p>

<p>Photo of Standard Dwarf Bearded Iris (Iris �Mordor Easy to grow, they can be left in the ground and will form a clump over time and give you years of pleasure. It should be easy to dig up as the feeder roots and rhizomes are shallow. Recent breeding of bearded iris has produced cultivars that are repeat bloomers. The dwarf varieties may start to unfurl their buds as early as september and median bearded iris will continue the colour spectacle in a few weeks later. Plan to plant your irises a minimum of four to six weeks before. Another way of extending the floral display of your bearded irises is to select reblooming iris varieties, which will flower in spring and again from late summer into fall depending on climate and growing conditions.</p>

<p>Bearded Iris Circus World Plants, Shrubs, Flowers Bearded irises (sometimes sold as iris germanica cultivars) have large fleshy stems (rhizomes) at soil level and flowers with soft hairs (the ‘beard’) on their lower petals (falls). In late spring tulips and peonies are flowering and this is the time when the bearded iris type flowers. Dwarf varieties tend to bloom earlier in spring, with intermediate sizes blooming later spring, and taller bearded varieties blooming late spring and summer. Even though reblooming irises don’t go dormant, this is also the correct time to divide those varieties. It should be easy to dig up as the feeder roots and rhizomes are shallow. Bearded irises flower at different times between april and june according to their variety.</p>
