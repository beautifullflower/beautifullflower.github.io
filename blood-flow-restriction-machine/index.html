Free shipping on orders over $200* sales inquires: Blood flow restriction (bfr) training Blood flow restriction, also known as bfr, involves wrapping a device such as a pressure cuff, occlusion training bands, or even knee wraps around the top portion of a limb to restrict blood flow out of the working muscle. However, the veins are restricted so that blood is partially prevented from leaving the working muscle.</p>

Bfr technology minimizes the effects of limited extremity use, shortens rehab time, and has been shown to enhance outcomes.

By applying a tourniquet briefly and intermittently to an exercising limb you can induce significant and substantial strength, hypertrophy and endurance changes while using a very light load. While traditional resistance exercise strength &amp; hypertrophy must be done with heavy loads, blood flow restriction is the opposite. Blood flow restriction means using a specialized tourniquet system (not unlike what a nurse or similar would wrap around your arm before drawing blood) to decrease blood flow to your limbs, explains hannah dove, d.p.t., a.t.c., c.s.c.s., a doctor of physical therapy at providence saint john�s health center�s performance therapy in santa monica, ca.

More studies have focused on isolated joints, most often the knee, ankle, and elbow, as opposed to total extremity. It was not until the early 2000s when tubes and wraps were replaced with “air cuffs”. The aim of this review was to systematically analyse the evidence regarding the effectiveness of this novel training modality in clinical msk rehabilitation.
