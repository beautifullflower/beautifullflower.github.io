<p><strong>Female Cucumber Flower Vs Male</strong>, In order for the female flowers to produce fruit, they must receive pollen from the male flowers. Male flowers generally outnumber the female flowers on most varieties of cucumber plants, and they open about 10 days before the female flowers. Without the flush of male blooms to attract bees, the female blooms might suffer.</p>

The first secret to boosting your cuke crop through flower power is to recognize the male and female blossoms.

Female flowers will have a green (or red) swollen cone in the center of each flower.

They seem to make more male flowers when it is hot in the greenhouse, but the female flowers will still set fruit on their own, provided they have enough moisture at the roots. Male flowers differ in appearance from female flowers by having shorter stems and growing in clusters of three to five, while the female flower blooms singly; It�s very hot and humid so i�m watering twice a day now. The only problem is that the plants are only producing male flowers. The male flowers typically develop on the main stem earlier and in larger numbers than female flowers.</p>
