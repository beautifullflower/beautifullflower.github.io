Don’t water the plant daily and make sure you let the soil dry out somewhat between waterings. To help keep your aglaonema plant full and bushy, remove some of the new leaves as they appear.

<p>Aglaonema (Chinese Evergreen) Reanita. Proper wateringis Aglaonema is native to very warm and humid areas in nature. I thought it was root bound, so i reported it. I�ve lost some newer plants in the center. That means in natural space it receives indirect sunlight. Every other time i water my red aglaonema, i take it to the sink, spray the foliage and leave it in there for an hour or 2 to temporarily up the ante on the humidity factor. These plants do not like cold drafts or temperatures below 65.</p>
