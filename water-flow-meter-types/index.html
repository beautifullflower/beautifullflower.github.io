Based in canterbury, nzflow provides advice on the supply, maintenance &amp; verification of flow meters: These are classified into different types based on its application like a mechanical, optical and open channel.</p>

A flow meter is a device used to measure the mass or volume of a gas or liquid. The speed of the flow can then be converted into a volume of flow to determine the usage.

<p>Pin on Fasteners and Hardware The fluid flow meters are important to accurately monitor liquid flow in refineries, power generation, and water treatment plants. There are several working principles to choose from, depending on the application, maintenance needs, and budget. This type of flow meter relies on bernoulli’s equation to judge the flow of fluids through a pipe. The most common flow meter is a differential pressure meter consisting of an orifice with a concentric round hole machined to a specific value. They are installed on closed pipes, and most often used to measure the flow of liquids. The water flow turns an impeller which rotates at a known speed compared to the water speed.</p>
