<p>Swedish Flower Chickens have tons of diversity to them Very appropriate since the feathers remind you of flowers. It was relatively unknown until the 19 70’s and 1980’s when a handful of swedish flowers were found in a rural swedish village. Obviously white eggs remain white but the ones that are going to be brown eggs travel down the oviduct as white and the color is applied right before the egg is laid. 150 eggs per year averaging 1 egg every other day. The average swedish flower hen will lay about 150 eggs per year. They love human attention and are a reliable egg layer.</p>
