<p>Pocket Edition Blacksmith Village + Mushroom Island Seed Fans of winter themed minecraft seeds can find more here. So we were doing a manhunt with my friend and my friend was the speedrunner. If you go way out east you will find a village with a blacksmith (not in the video, unfortunately). The biome is 1000 blocks from the spawn. You should also know that a seed is always a number (up to around 20 digits). There is a flower biome village here.</p>
