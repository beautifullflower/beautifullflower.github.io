It is composed of the stigma, style and ovary, which houses the ovules that eventually become seeds. The main difference between hypogynous and epigynous flower is that hypogynous flower has a superior ovary whereas epigynous flower has an inferior ovary. Based on the position of calyx, corolla and androecium in respect of the ovary on thalamus (receptacle), the flowers can be described as hypogenous, perigynous or epigynous. In a flower the female reproductive part is called the pistil. Inside the ovary are tiny ovules, which after undergoing meiosis, will produce ova or tiny egg cells.</p>

Merosity is simply the number of parts in each whorl of a plant structure, whether it is the number of sepals, petals in a corolla, or the number of stamens.
