In this section of the lesson i have students design a flower whose structure will allow it to have optimal probability of having reproductive success. In the event of a favorable pollination where a compatible pollen reaches the stigma and eventually reaches the ovary to fuse with the ovules, this fertilized product forms the fruit and the ovules become the seeds of the fruit. Because of the bright petals, these reproductive organs are not as visible as they are in some other types of. Sticky part of the flower that collects pollen from the air or pollinators.</p>
