During systole, blood enters the arteries, and the artery walls stretch to accommodate the extra blood. This video describes how blood flows in and out of the heart. The circulation system has two blood flow pipelines. Placed at the venticles� entrances and exits, these four valves ensure that the blood moves only forward and does not flow back into the chambers when the heart muscle relaxes. Through association with the alveoli the blood is oxygenated in the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins, before passing into the left ventricle and being pumped around the body.</p>
