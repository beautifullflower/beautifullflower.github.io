<p>Pin by Eugenia L on BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES and MORE ! Spine Bible verses about flowers in the bible flowers are often used as symbolism for beauty, growth, temporal things, fullness, and more. The lotus flower is often seen as a divine and pure symbol. The most common lotus form seen in hinduism is the white lotus flower. Buddhist think water lilies and lotus represent enlightenment. It is also said that the closed, or budded, lotus flower symbolises man’s infinite possibilities. There are many deities (gods) in hinduism that are depicted holding a lotus in their hand.</p>

<p>133 Likes, 5 Comments Dana Claudat (thetaoofdana) on More passionately colored red, purple, and blue lotus flower blooms can take on a spiritual meaning of ascension, enlightenment, or rebirth. In buddhism the blue lotus flower is symbolic with a victory over the spirit of self, that is to say being able to leave wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge behind and becoming open to spirituality and the attachment to life. They grow in ponds, lakes, and edges of streams, just as a lotus does. It symbolises our growth and spiritual development. Hindus believe that each person possesses the spirit of the lotus. It grows in marshes and streams and the plant grows large enough to cover and conceal the behemoth.</p>

<p>Hello Dribbble Dribbble, Dribbble design, Graphic poster They also think these flowers have many different meanings that all depend on the color of the flower. The lotus flower is often seen as a divine and pure symbol. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. So, while it is not explicitly stated in the bible, the lotus plant does point us to the resurrected savior of christianity. Its roots fasten firmly to the murky bottom of a pond or river, while its stunning flowers bloom brightly above the surface. Buddhist think water lilies and lotus represent enlightenment.</p>
