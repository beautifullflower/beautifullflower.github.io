Dried lily flowers (黄花, huang hua), also known as dried lily buds or golden needles, are the unopened flowers of the day lily plant. The buds look like long golden to darker brown strips. The buds are used in numerous chinese traditional dishes but most prominently in jai or hot and sour soup which is a dish prepared for pre new years celebration. Be sure to squeeze the lily flowers dry as well and trim off the tough ends. The flowers look more like 3 inches of golden brown stalks, and probably not the most appetizing thing judging from their appearance.</p>
