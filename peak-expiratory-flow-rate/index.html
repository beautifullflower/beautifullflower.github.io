<p>Peak expiratory flow rate measurement &amp; explanation OSCE The measurement obtained indicates the degree of airway narrowing and obstruction. The peak expiratory flow (pef, also known as a peak flow or peak flow rate) is the maximal rate that a person can exhale during a short maximal expiratory effort after a full inspiration. What is a peak expiratory flow rate test? Peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) monitoring could provide a daily objective measurement of lung function in copd patients at home. It measures the airflow through the bronchi and thus the degree of obstruction in the airways. Readings are obtained using peak expiratory flow rate meters, or peak flow meters.</p>

Purpose of a peak flow meter. Low peak inspiratory flow rate (pifr) (&lt;60 l/min) among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) may result in ineffective medication inhalation, leading to poor bronchodilation. Estimated/expected peak expiratory flow (peak flow) quantifies asthma exacerbation severity. This is given in litres of air breathed out per minute (l/min). Peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) is the maximum flow rate generated during a forceful exhalation, starting from full lung inflation.</p>

In contrast, our mean peak expiratory flow rates for all groups ranged from 92 to 95% of the predicted rate. Reference values for swedish children. The material consisted of 143 boys and 132 girls. Pefr is defined as a person�s maximum speed of expiration. Peak expiratory flow (pef) is the maximum flow achieved during a forced expiration starting from the level of maximal lung inflation.</p>

Pefr is defined as a person�s maximum speed of expiration. The measurement obtained indicates the degree of airway narrowing and obstruction. 37 primarily a measure of large airway caliber, pef can be used to identify and assess airflow limitation in clinical practice and epidemiologic studies and can aid in the monitoring of disease progress and the effects of treatment.

This makes it ideal for monitoring obstructive diseases such as asthma. 4 in copd, however, the utility of pefr monitoring remains unclear. Peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) monitoring could provide a daily objective measurement of lung function in copd patients at home.</p>
