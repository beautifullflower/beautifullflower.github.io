<p>Such a pretty Spring arrangement. We love the ranunculus Unlike most of my items, the flower has been made with modern glass and has a yellow glass bead centre. Macro of a backlit pink dahlia flower with white stripes and a yellow, orange center illuminated by sunlight. This plant is more commonly referred to as “alpine cat’s ears”. Unlike most of my items, the flower has been made with modern glass and has a yellow glass bead centre. Flowers are ½ to ¾ inches across with 2 to 15 irregularly spaced white petals (ray flowers) and a yellow center disk that turns dull, pale, yellowish tan with age. Many species flower a second time late summer, stimulated by the cooler night.</p>
