The major function of a flower ovary is to produce four structures: The flowering plants are a large group of seed plants that called angiospermae, as their seeds develop within a pericarp, they are common in various habitats and vary in the size from small herbs to giant trees, the flowering plants reproduce by a specialized organ which called the flower.</p>

<p>In the flowering plants, an ovary is a part of the female reproductive organ of the flower. It is attached to the top of the carpel, where the pollen from other flowers lands. When an insect or bird is attracted to a flower by its bright color, they get pollen on them. The ovary is a chamber where ovules (eggs) are stored, waiting for fertilization. Further, ovaries occur in both animals and the flower of plants.</p>

The ovaries act as a kind of protective chamber around the fragile ovules, which develop into seeds from which new plants grow. It is a tubular structure that connects the ovary and the stigma. Several tissues, known collectively as the reproductive tract, develop within the carpel to facilitate the journey of the pollen tube.</p>

Once the fertilization process is over, the ovary develops into fruit in flowering plants. The stamen is considered the male portion of a plant because it is where sperm is produced and housed within pollen grains. It is a tubular structure that connects the ovary and the stigma. The function of the style is to check compatibility and judge whether the pollen that lands on the flower can fertilize the plant. Many foods commonly called vegetables are actually fruit.</p>

In the flowering plants, an ovary is a part of the female reproductive organ of the flower or gynoecium.specifically, it is the part of the pistil which holds the ovule(s) and is located above or below or at the point of connection with the base of the petals and sepals.the pistil may be made up of one carpel or of several fused carpels (e.g. In plants, ovule occurs inside the ovary of plants, which develops the seed following fertilization. Insects and birds can play an important role in pollinating plants. The female ovary is contained within the plant carpel.</p>
