<p>Pin on Animal crossing Thanks to the animal crossing community for trying to piece together all of these flower combinations. Violet violets can be planted with violet bags, which can be bought from leif�s store. Cross pollinating two hybrid flowers of the same color is also one way to make more of the same flower. Black, purple, and blue flowers are easy to get in animal crossing with a little patience! This is done by cross pollinating red and yellow tulips first and then using the orange tulips to make purple tulips. Orange lilies = red + yellow;</p>

<p>Pin by Pissi88 on Animal Crossing Animal crossing, New See the list of required materials from below. Much like fruit trees, every island in animal crossing: There are 8 different flower types, and 52 different regular colored flowers, plus gold roses and the lily of the valley, for a total of 54 different flowers. These flowers boast vibrant colors and impact the overall appearance of the players’ island. The simplest ones to make are: For instance, the peacock butterfly appears only when blue, black, or purple flowers are present.</p>

<p>Pin by Meg Callum on inspiration;//acnl Tumblr app, App Orange lilies = red + yellow; You can pick lily�s flower by pressing y and create lily wreath. The related dandelion, a variety of weed, attracts only orchid mantises. Black tulips = red + red; Here’s a list of the possible colors you can get if you plant lilies next to each other and water them with a watering can. Purple tulips = orange + orange, black + black;</p>
