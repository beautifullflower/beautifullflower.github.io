<p><strong>Flow Cytometry Results For Lymphoma</strong>, Flow cytometry can identify the type of cells in a blood or bone marrow sample, including the types of cancer cells. To evaluate the role of flow cytometric immunophenotyping (fci) in diagnosis and characterization of lymphoma tissue specimens from egyptian patients. The role of flow cytometry in the diagnosis of lymphoma:</p>

<p>In 4 cases, neoplastic cells could not be identified. Flow cytometry, now used routinely to aid in the classification of leukemias, is increasingly being evaluated as a rapid technique for determination of surface antigens on the cells teased from lymph nodes and other masses with suspected lymphoma. We show that much like cd30+ tumor cells of classical hodgkin lymphoma (chl) and alcl of non‐breast implant tumors, the neoplastic cells of this entity can be readily identified by flow cytometry. The lack of cd5 expression is helpful in the discrimination between smzl and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (cll/sll), and the lack of cd10 expression argues against follicular lymphoma (fl). Lineage identification can provide a confirmatory diagnosis or differential diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options.</p>

Flow cytometry, now used routinely to aid in the classification of leukemias, is increasingly being evaluated as a rapid technique for determination of surface antigens on the cells teased from lymph nodes and other masses with suspected lymphoma. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is characterized in most cases by a surface. Like people, lymphocytes have a life span which includes stages of maturation where the appearance changes as do the behaviors and roles in the body as the cells mature. If no abnormalities are detected by the initial panel, no further flow cytometric assessment will be performed unless otherwise indicated by specific features of the clinical presentation or prior laboratory results.</p>

Existing normative data for lymph node biopsies are based on small studies, many of which report a minority of flow gates used in routine diagnostics and were performed outside the clinical setting. The findings help healthcare professionals diagnose specific types of blood cancers, determine treatment approaches and monitor the response to treatment.
