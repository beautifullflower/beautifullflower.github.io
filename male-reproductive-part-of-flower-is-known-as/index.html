<p>It is crucial in the reproduction of flowering plants, as it produces the male gametophyte, known as pollen. Pistil or carpel are called the female reproductive parts of the flower. The stamen�s function is to produce male reproductive cells. Flowers that contain both androecium and gynoecium are called hermaphroditic. Male reproductive organ of a flower.</p>
<h3 id="the-male-reproductive-organs-of-a-plant-plant">The male reproductive organs of a plant plant.</h3><p>When a flower has all the four floral parts, it is called a complete flower. The male reproductive part of the flower produces pollen, while the flowers do more than add color to a garden. The main flower parts are the male part called the stamen and the female part called the pistil. Pollen is not sperm, but will make sperm (or male gametes) once pollination, or when the pollen is transferred to the female part of a plant, occurs.
