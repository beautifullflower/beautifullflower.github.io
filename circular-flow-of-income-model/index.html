<p>So far the circular flow of income and expenditure has been shown in the case of a closed economy. The circular flow model, also known as the circular flow of income, describes how money and economic resources flow in cycles between different sectors in an economic system. If the government spends all its income received in the form of taxes, it flows back to the household and business sector in the form of subsidies and other government expenditures. The flows of money and goods exchanged in a closed circuit correspond in value, but run in the opposite direction. Real flows of resources, goods and services have been shown in fig.</p>

<p>Click to enlarge the chart Finance, Development, Chart If the government spends all its income received in the form of taxes, it flows back to the household and business sector in the form of subsidies and other government expenditures. Circular income flow in a three sector economy with government: This circular flow of income also shows the three different ways that national income is calculated. They create incomes for the domestic firms.

An economy can be defined as a unified arrangement of production, distribution, exchange, consumption and investment.</p>

<p>Pin on Business and Marketing Illustrated The circular flow of income is the model of the economy in which the major exchanges are represented as flows of money, goods and services etc. The most common form of this model shows the circular flow of income between the household sector and the business sector. In a closed circular income stream, money flows continuously from firms to households. Exports are an injection or inflows into the economy. It results in a gap between supply and demand. The basic model of the circular flow of income ignores common consumer actions that take money out of the circular of income, or leakage.</p>

<p>A recursive gasket with 7 + 1 initial circles Figure 3 It shows the redistribution of income in a circular manner between the production unit and households. Let us start with a simplified model involving two sectors, namely, household sector and firm sector, assuming that there is no government. This leads to the continuous circular flow of national income within the economy. In a closed circular income stream, money flows continuously from firms to households. But the actual economy is an open one where foreign trade plays an important role. The final sector in the circular flow of income model is the overseas sector which transforms the model from a closed economy to an open economy.</p>
