<p>Make sure that the furnace is wired correctly and is properly grounded. Determine where on the furnace you can find the filter air box. Watch this video for help in determining the air flow direction for a furnace filter. If the filter sat after the furnace, there would be potential hazards associated with it, like possibility of fire (hot air hitting a cardboard frame) and release of nasty substances due to overheating. Carrier furnace air flow direction.</p>

The thickness is also a consideration. If you have a gas valve that has a pv (pilot valve) and an mv (main valve) then i would think that either you are not getting the 24 volts to the pv since the pilot is not lighting to continue the furnace ignition sequence. Page 23 generator should have a wave form distortion of less 2 − when the 80af1df is running in the heating mode, the than 5% thd (total harmonic distortion). On the new filter, find the arrow indicating the proper airflow direction.</p>

When you install a new air filter into the ac return duct the arrows face inward to specify which way the air is flowing. Dirty air filters also force your hvac system to work harder than necessary, decreasing equipment’s life and increasing your energy bills. Stand in front of the furnace and look for the ducts. The filter sits between the air return duct and the heat chamber, before the cool air enters the furnace.</p>

Watch this video for help in determining the air flow direction for a furnace filter. Furnace filters usually range from 1 to 2 inches thick, but some can be thicker. The frame of the existing filter should show the size, which can vary from one unit to the next. This will make it more difficult for your air handler to keep air flowing through the filter, which will force your furnace to work harder and consume more energy to make up for the loss of airflow.
