<p>DIY Flower Food 1 quart water, 1 teaspoon bleach, 1 If you did not get one, here are some easy ways to make your own homemade flower food or diy cut flower food. Add the liquid mix to any bottle of your choosing, preferably one with a spray attachment or pour directly into the vase containing the flower in need of a good feed. Change this every few days. Sugar encourages bacteria growth while at the same time it feeds your flowers. White vinegar is acidic and will curb the bacteria that may grow because of the sugar. Use equal parts dissolved sugar and vinegar to supply adequate levels of sucrose and acidify the water.</p>

If you want to get all advanced you can adjust the sugar based on the flowers in your vase. Sit quietly with the flower, meditate, draw or write.</p>
