<h3 id="watch-as-pure-fresh-honey-flows-right-out-of-the-hive-and-into-your-jar">Watch as pure, fresh honey flows right out of the hive and into your jar.</h3><p>In response to requests for a larger hive, we have created a 7 frame flow hive that is compatible with 10 frame langstroth equipment. The flow frames are in the super box and allow you to harvest/drain honey without opening up the hive, removing frames and disturbing the bees. If a second hive is located close to a different tree or flower, you’ll get a different kind of honey. It is absolutely ingenious and, from the response of avid apiarist and urban beekeeper alike, the effect this could have on the beekeeping industry, and those interested in saving the bees, is immense. If you must treat the hive, it should be done weeks before or after you the honey flow.</p>
