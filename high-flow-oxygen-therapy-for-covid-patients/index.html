<p><strong>High Flow Oxygen Therapy For Covid Patients</strong>, In recent years, hfno has become a commonly used therapy for patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Oxygen therapy is the most basic and critical treatment for these patients. The aim of this study was to compare the risk of imv between two strategies of oxygenation (conventional oxygenation and hfno) in critically ill covid 19 patients.</p>

<p>Hyperbaric chamber oxygen therapy for patients with wounds Commence oxygen aiming at target range, contact respiratory team* and monitor closely. In recent years, hfno has become a commonly used therapy for patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. In recent years, high flow nasal cannula (hfnc) is a respiratory support system that has become prominent in the treatment of respiratory failure. Optiflow™ nasal high flow (nhf) therapy is being used to treat patients in affected hospitals, while the awareness of nhf continues to grow as countries manage waves of the pandemic. The aim of this study was to compare the risk of imv between two strategies of oxygenation (conventional oxygenation and hfno) in critically ill covid 19 patients. The use of high‐flow nasal oxygen (hfno) in covid‐19 is the subject of much debate, relating to the benefits and harms that may result for patients and healthcare workers alike.</p>

The patient breathes the adequately heated and humidified medical gas through nasal cannulas with a large diameter. In recent years, high flow nasal cannula (hfnc) is a respiratory support system that has become prominent in the treatment of respiratory failure. It works by redistributing the blood flow through the lungs, helping better match the airflow to the blood supply and getting patients back up to better oxygen levels. The maximum gas flow rates can be from 40 to 60 litre per minute, whereas the heating and the humidifying.</p>
