<p>This is a maf sensor which ensures the efficient mix of air and fuel so that your vehicle consumes an optimum level of fuel and significantly reduces harmful emissions. These may include low gas mileage, shuddering, stalling, knocking or pinging. If after disconnecting the maf nothing changes, it means, that maf has became bad. It feels like it is holding back, this is because the air flow meter is not telling the �brain� the airflow has increased. Locate the mass air flow sensor, towards the back of the engine.</p>

<p>Flow meter When it comes to flow technology, you have a When the device goes bad, it can lead to various symptoms, ranging from an illuminated check engine light to rough running and misfiring. A faulty or failing sensor will not cause the engine light to illuminate. If the maf is bad (either because it�s not producing a signal or producing an erratic one), the car�s idle will return to normal and the car will seem to run fine. I�m sorry to say changing the crank sensor will not do the trick but what is a good idea is cleaning the erg valve because it will be close to being blocked. The symptoms of a bad mass air flow sensor include low engine power, poor fuel economy, an engine that won�t start, a check engine light on the dash and a gas smell from the exhaust fumes. Performance and circuit diagnostic trouble codes may refer directly to the maf sensor, but fuel trim and misfire codes can also be linked to the maf sensor.</p>

Problems that occur in flow meters or flow sensors can cause the product quality and efficiency to decrease and may lead to damage in the machine tools. Performance and circuit diagnostic trouble codes may refer directly to the maf sensor, but fuel trim and misfire codes can also be linked to the maf sensor. Cleaning the maf sensor is often relatively straightforward. The symptoms of a bad mass air flow sensor include low engine power, poor fuel economy, an engine that won�t start, a check engine light on the dash and a gas smell from the exhaust fumes.
