<p>Beautiful elephant ears Plants, Elephant ears, Beautiful As language and cultures evolved and knowledge of elephants crossed the ocean, a plant that came to be known as “elephant’s ear” was also used as a medicinal tea by cheyenne people. Remove the plant from the container and place it in the hole, so that the soil level of the plant is the same as the surrounding soil. For instance, bulb flowers such as tulips, daffodils, irises, hyacinths and day lilies provide a variety of color in spring and summer.when planted in fall, these flowers do especially well in areas where they receive full sun. The drip tips its the pointy end of the plant so when it rains the water that is caught on the leaves drips down to the point into the soil so it can use it. The tubers can be placed directly outdoors once the threat of frost or freezing temperatures have ceased in your area. Leaves are very large, broadly ovate, the larger ones up to 1.5 meters long, with slightly undulate margins, a pointed apex and a deeply cordate base, not at all peltate.</p>
