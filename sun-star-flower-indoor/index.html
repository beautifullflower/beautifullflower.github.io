<p>Blue star fern care Phlebodium aureum Houseplant Ideal planting locations are those with a western or southern exposure. The sun star, or ornithogalum dubium, is a perennial in the lily family. Their light requirements vary from full sun to bright indirect light, which means you’ll have no trouble finding something for every room of the house and office. Propagation is usually done by separating bulblets and planting them individually. Lavender star flower prefers full sun, which promotes the best growth and more robust blooming, however, it will tolerate shade as well. The name starfish flower cactus is misleading.</p>
