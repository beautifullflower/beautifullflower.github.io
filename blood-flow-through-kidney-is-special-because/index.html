Blood flow through the kidney the urinary system plays a major role in maintaining homeostasis by altering the composition, ph, volume, blood pressure, and by producing hormones. Blood flow through the kidney. When blood flow is restored, kidney function improves and the high blood pressure caused by a blocked kidney artery may be lowered.
