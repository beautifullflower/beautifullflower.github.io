Flow cytometry (fc) is a technique used to detect and measure physical and chemical characteristics of a population of cells or particles. Summary flow cytometry plays a significant role in the diagnosis and classification of acute leukemia. To evaluate the usefulness of flow cytometric detection of intracellular antigens (ags) in establishing proper lineage affiliation and its contribution to the diagnosis of acute leukemia, we studied 100 consecutive patients in whom acute leukemia. It detects types of cancer cells based on either the presence or the absence of certain protein markers (antigens) on a cell’s surface. The fc pattern in cml was compared with benign (healthy) controls (blood, 20 cases;</p>
